It is categorized into two main types based on the presence of a uterus:  \n\n#### Estrogen-Progesterone Replacement Therapy (EPT)  \nEPT, a form of combination HRT, combines estrogen with a progestogen (progesterone or synthetic progestin) and is prescribed to individuals with an intact uterus. The progestogen component is critical for preventing estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the uterine lining), thereby reducing the risk of endometrial cancer. EPT is used to treat moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, night sweats) and vaginal dryness, as well as to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis).  \n\n**Administration and Regimens**: EPT is available in oral (pill) or transdermal (skin patch) forms, with dosages individualized to the lowest effective level. Regimens include:  \n- **Continuous-combined**: Daily estrogen and progesterone.  \n- **Cyclic**: Daily estrogen with 12–15 days of monthly progesterone.  \n\n**Benefits**: Relieves vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats), vaginal dryness, and prevents osteoporosis.  \n\n**Risks**: Vary by age, dose, duration, and route of administration. Potential risks include a small increased risk of breast cancer with long-term use, blood clots, stroke, and gallbladder disease. Risks are lower when initiated before age 60 or within 10 years of menopause onset.  \n\n#### Estrogen Replacement Therapy (ET)  \nET involves estrogen alone and is prescribed to individuals without a uterus (e.g., post-hysterectomy) to avoid the need for progestogen (and thus endometrial cancer risk). It effectively relieves menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness) and may protect bones. Additionally, ET may lower cardiovascular disease risk when initiated within 10 years of menopause or in individuals under age 60.  \n\n**Administration**: Available in systemic forms (oral, transdermal) and low-dose vaginal preparations (e.g., creams, rings) for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Vaginal ET has minimal systemic absorption, resulting in lower risks compared to systemic administration.  \n\n**Risks**: Systemic ET carries risks of increased stroke, blood clots (especially with oral administration), and breast cancer risk after 7 years of use.  \n\n### Cancer Hormone Therapy  \nHormone therapy (also called hormonal therapy, hormone treatment, or endocrine therapy) is a cancer treatment that slows or stops the growth of cancers dependent on hormones for growth, such as some prostate and breast cancers.  \n\n#### Purpose and Uses  \n- **Treat cancer**: Stops or slows cancer growth and reduces recurrence risk.  \n- **Ease symptoms**: May reduce symptoms in patients with advanced cancer who cannot undergo surgery or radiation.  \n\n#### Mechanisms  \nHormone therapy acts by either blocking the body’s ability to produce hormones or interfering with hormone signaling in cancer cells.  \n\n#### Cancers Treated  \n- **Prostate cancer**: Targets androgens (male hormones like testosterone), which fuel tumor growth.  \n- **Breast cancer**: Targets estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER/PR-positive tumors), as these hormones promote cancer cell proliferation.  \n\n#### Administration Methods  \n- **Oral**: Pills taken at home (e.g., tamoxifen for breast cancer, anti-androgens for prostate cancer).  \n- **Injection**: Shots administered in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital (e.g., luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists for prostate cancer).  \n- **Surgery**: Removal of hormone-producing organs (e.g., ovariectomy in women to eliminate ovarian estrogen; orchiectomy in men to remove testicular androgens).  \n\n#### Use with Other Treatments  \n- **Neoadjuvant therapy**: Shrinks tumors before surgery or radiation.  \n- **Adjuvant therapy**: Lowers recurrence risk after primary treatment (e.g., surgery).  \n- **Metastatic disease**: Destroys cancer cells that have spread (recurrent or advanced cancer).  \n\n#### Side Effects  \nSide effects vary by cancer type, treatment, and individual response, with gender-specific differences:  \n\n**Men (Prostate Cancer)**:  \n- Hot flashes  \n- Loss of libido or erectile dysfunction  \n- Weakened bones (osteoporosis)  \n- Diarrhea, nausea  \n- Gynecomastia (enlarged, tender breasts)  \n- Fatigue  \n\n**Women (Breast Cancer)**:  \n- Hot flashes  \n- Vaginal dryness  \n- Menstrual changes (in premenopausal women)  \n- Loss of libido  \n- Nausea, mood changes  \n- Fatigue  \n\n#### Monitoring Efficacy  \n- **Prostate cancer**: Regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests; stable or decreased PSA levels indicate effectiveness, while rising levels may signal treatment resistance.  \n- **Breast cancer**: Regular clinical exams (neck, underarm, chest, breast), mammograms (excluding reconstructed breasts), and imaging/lab tests as needed.  \n\n#### Cost Considerations  \nCost depends on treatment type, duration, frequency, and geographic location. Most insurance plans cover hormone therapy; patients are advised to consult their provider and treatment center’s business office for details.  \n\n### Key Clinical Associations  \n- **Menopause MHT**: Benefits are most pronounced for severe vasomotor symptoms and osteoporosis prevention in early postmenopause (age <60 or within 10 years of menopause). Risks (e.g., breast cancer, stroke) increase with longer duration (>5 years) and older age at initiation.  \n- **Cancer Hormone Therapy**: Effectiveness is linked to hormone receptor status (e.g., ER/PR-positive breast cancer, androgen-dependent prostate cancer). Resistance may develop over time, requiring alternative treatments.  \n\nIn summary, hormone therapy is a versatile medical approach with distinct applications in menopause management (replacing deficient hormones) and cancer treatment (blocking hormone-dependent tumor growth), each with specific mechanisms, benefits, risks, and monitoring requirements.", "page_summaries": [{"url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372", "title": "Comparing the risks and benefits of hormone therapy", "summary": "Estrogen-progesterone replacement therapy is a type of menopause hormone therapy prescribed to individuals with a uterus, combining estrogen with a progestogen (progesterone-like medicine) to replace estrogen lost after menopause.

Hormone therapy is also called hormonal therapy, hormone treatment, or endocrine therapy.\n\nHow hormone therapy is used against cancer\n------------------------------------------\n\nHormone therapy is used for two main reasons.\n\n*   **Treat cancer.** Hormone therapy can stop or slow cancer's growth and reduce the chance it will return.\n*   **Ease cancer**[**symptoms**](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45022)**.** Hormone therapy may be used to reduce or prevent symptoms in men with prostate cancer who are not able to have [surgery](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45570) or [radiation therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44971).\n\nTypes of hormone therapy\n------------------------\n\nHormone therapy falls into two broad groups, those that block the body’s ability to produce hormones and those that interfere with how hormones behave in the body.\n\nCancers treated with hormone therapy\n------------------------------------\n\nHormone therapy is used to treat prostate and breast cancers that use hormones to grow. Hormone therapy is most often used along with other cancer treatments. The types of treatment that you need depend on the type of cancer, if it has spread and how far, if it uses hormones to grow, and if you have other health problems.\n\nHow hormone therapy is used with other cancer treatments\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen used with other treatments, hormone therapy can:\n\n*   make a tumor smaller before surgery or radiation therapy (called neoadjuvant therapy)\n*   lower the risk that cancer will come back after the main treatment (called adjuvant therapy)\n*   destroy cancer [cells](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46476) that have returned or spread to other parts of your body\n\nHormone therapy can cause side effects\n--------------------------------------\n\nBecause hormone therapy blocks your body’s ability to produce hormones or interferes with how hormones behave, it can cause unwanted side effects. The side effects you have will depend on the type of hormone therapy you receive and how your body responds to it. People respond differently to the same treatment, so not everyone gets the same side effects. Some side effects also differ if you are a man or a woman.\n\nSome common side effects for men who receive hormone therapy for prostate cancer include:\n\n*   [hot flashes](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/256567)\n*   loss of interest in or ability to have sex\n*   weakened bones\n*   [diarrhea](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/diarrhea)\n*   [nausea](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea-vomiting)\n*   enlarged and tender breasts\n*   [fatigue](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue)\n\nLearn more about [sexual health issues in men with cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/sexuality-men).\n\nSome common side effects for women who receive hormone therapy for breast cancer include:\n\n*   hot flashes\n*   vaginal dryness\n*   changes in your periods if you have not yet reached [menopause](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46296)\n*   loss of interest in sex\n*   [nausea](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea-vomiting)\n*   mood changes\n*   [fatigue](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue)\n\nLearn more about [sexual health issues in women with cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/sexuality-women).\n\nHow much hormone therapy costs\n------------------------------\n\nThe cost of hormone therapy depends on:\n\n*   the types of hormone therapy you receive\n*   how long and how often you receive hormone therapy\n*   the part of the country where you live\n\nTalk with your health insurance company about what services it will pay for. Most insurance plans pay for hormone therapy for their members. To learn more, talk with the business office where you go for treatment. You can also call [NCI's Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact) toll free at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) to ask for help.\n\nHow hormone therapy is given\n----------------------------\n\nHormone therapy may be given in many ways:\n\n*   **Oral.**Hormone therapy comes in pills that you swallow.\n*   **Injection.** The hormone therapy is given by a shot in a muscle in your arm, thigh, or hip, or right under the skin in the fatty part of your arm, leg, or belly.\n*   [**Surgery**](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45570)**.** You may have surgery to remove [organs](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/257523) that produce hormones. In women, the [ovaries](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46687) are removed. In men, the [testicles](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46611) are removed.\n\nWhere you receive hormone therapy\n---------------------------------\n\nWhere you receive treatment depends on which hormone therapy you are getting and how it is given. You may take hormone therapy at home. Or you may receive hormone therapy in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital.\n\nHow hormone therapy may affect you\n----------------------------------\n\nHormone therapy affects people in different ways. How you feel depends on the type of cancer you have, how advanced it is, the type of hormone therapy you are getting, and the [dose](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44664). Your doctors and nurses cannot know for certain how you will feel during hormone therapy.\n\nHow to tell if hormone therapy is working\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you are taking hormone therapy for prostate cancer, you will have regular [PSA](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44867) tests. If hormone therapy is working, your PSA levels will stay the same or may even go down. But, if your PSA levels go up, this may be a sign that the treatment is no longer working. If this happens, your doctor will discuss treatment options with you.\n\nIf you are taking hormone therapy for breast cancer, you will have regular check-ups. Checkups usually include an exam of the neck, underarm, chest, and breast areas. You will have regular mammograms, though you probably won’t need a mammogram of a reconstructed breast. Your doctor may also order other [imaging procedures](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45720) or lab tests.\n\nSpecial diet needs\n------------------\n\nHormone therapy for prostate cancer may cause weight gain.

Its integrity is a primary determinant of plaque stability, with thinning or rupture directly linked to life-threatening clinical events such as myocardial infarction and stroke.\n\n### Structure and Composition  \nThe fibrous cap is characterized by a dense, collagen-rich matrix (primarily type I collagen) interspersed with elastin fibers, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), macrophages, foam cells, and lymphocytes. Compared to the normal arterial intima, it is thicker and less cellular but retains a dynamic cellular population. Key cellular components include:  \n- **Smooth muscle cells (SMCs):** Derived primarily from clonal expansion of medial SMCs, which migrate into the intima, proliferate, and differentiate into a synthetic phenotype to produce extracellular matrix (ECM). These cells express contractile proteins (e.g., ACTA2, MYH11) and PDGFRB, with subpopulations adopting chondrocyte-like (SOX9+, COL2A1+), fibroblast-like (LUM+, BGN+), or lipid-laden inflammatory phenotypes.  \n- **Macrophages and foam cells:** Infiltrate the cap, particularly at the \"shoulders\" (junction with normal intima), where they contribute to inflammation and ECM degradation via metalloproteinases (MMPs).  \n- **Lymphocytes:** Modulate local inflammation through cytokine secretion.  \n\nThe ECM composition, dominated by collagen and elastin, provides mechanical strength, while SMCs maintain structural integrity by balancing ECM synthesis and degradation.\n\n### Formation and Developmental Pathways  \nFibrous cap formation recapitulates embryonic arterial media development, relying on reactivation of three conserved signaling pathways:  \n1. **NOTCH signaling:** Guides mesenchymal precursors toward SMC fate, suppressing osteochondrogenic differentiation. Endothelial JAG1 and SMC NOTCH3 expression drive sequential SMC recruitment and maturation, with loss of NOTCH signaling reducing ACTA2+ cap SMCs.  \n2. **PDGF signaling:** PDGFB, secreted by endothelium, recruits PDGFRB+ mural cell precursors, promoting SMC migration, proliferation, and metabolic reprogramming for ECM synthesis. Persistent PDGFRB signaling is critical for SMC retention in the cap; inhibition shifts SMC sources to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) driven by IL1B.  \n3. **TCF21 signaling:** This transcription factor inhibits SMC differentiation by blocking the myocardin-serum response factor pathway. TCF21+ cells in the cap promote phenotypic switching toward fibroblast-like SMCs, with deletion reducing SMC lineage contribution to the cap.  \n\nIn humans, cap SMCs may also arise from pre-existing intimal SMCs or, in pathological states, via EMT. Clonal expansion of medial SMCs dominates in murine models, but human studies suggest oligoclonal populations may arise during development, intimal thickening, or atherosclerosis.\n\n### Clinical Significance: Stability and Rupture  \nPlaque stability hinges on fibrous cap thickness and composition. A **thick cap** (>65 μm) with abundant collagen and SMCs resists mechanical stress, classifying the plaque as \"stable.\" Conversely, a **thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA)**—defined by a cap <65 μm, large necrotic core, and heavy macrophage infiltration—is \"vulnerable\" and prone to rupture. Rupture occurs most frequently at the cap shoulders, where inflammation and MMP-mediated ECM degradation are highest, exposing thrombogenic core contents (e.g., tissue factor) to the bloodstream and triggering thrombosis.  \n\nCritical determinants of cap vulnerability include:  \n- **Thickness:** Coronary plaques with caps >65 μm rarely rupture; 95% of acute ruptures involve caps <65 μm.  \n- **Cellularity:** Hypocellular caps (due to SMC apoptosis or senescence) are up to five times less stiff than cellular/calcified caps.  \n- **Inflammation:** Macrophage-derived MMPs (e.g., MMP9) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1B) drive ECM breakdown, while T lymphocytes promote SMC loss.  \n- **Necrotic core size:** Larger lipid-rich necrotic cores (LRNC) correlate with cap thinning and rupture risk.  \n\n### Imaging and Assessment  \nThe fibrous cap is evaluated using advanced imaging modalities to stratify cardiovascular risk:  \n- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT):** Gold standard for measuring cap thickness (resolution ~10 μm) and detecting TCFA. Identifies cap disruption, thrombus, and macrophage infiltration.  \n- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):** Visualizes the cap as a juxtaluminal hypointense band on time-of-flight (TOF) sequences and enhances with gadolinium on T1-weighted images. Non-visualization suggests thinning or rupture.  \n- **Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS):** Detects TCFA via plaque burden (>40%) and confluent necrotic core (>10% of plaque area).  \n\n### Therapeutic Modulation  \nTherapies targeting the fibrous cap aim to enhance stability by promoting SMC recruitment, ECM synthesis, or reducing inflammation:  \n- **Lipid-lowering agents:** Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors (e.g., evolocumab) increase cap thickness by reducing LDL-driven inflammation and promoting SMC collagen production. In acute coronary syndrome patients, statins increase coronary/carotid cap thickness (OCT).  \n- **Anti-inflammatory therapies:** Colchicine and IL1B antagonists (e.g., canakinumab) reduce macrophage infiltration, though murine models show IL1B inhibition may paradoxically decrease cap SMCs.  \n- **SGLT2 inhibitors:** Improve cap thickness in type 2 diabetes by reducing glycemia and inflammation.  \n- **Targeted SMC therapies:** Modulation of NOTCH/PDGF signaling (e.g., PDGFRB inhibitors) risks cap thinning, while KLF4 knockout increases ACTA2+ SMCs and cap thickness in mice.  \n\n### Complications of Rupture  \nFibrous cap rupture exposes the subendothelial matrix and necrotic core, triggering platelet activation, thrombus formation, and vasospasm. This can occlude the artery, leading to:  \n- **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS):** Rupture of coronary TCFA causes myocardial infarction in ~70% of cases.  \n- **Ischemic stroke:** Carotid plaque rupture leads to embolic occlusion of cerebral vessels.  \n- **Thrombosis:** Exposed tissue factor and collagen activate the coagulation cascade, with thrombus size dependent on rupture severity.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nThe fibrous cap is a dynamic, developmentally conserved structure whose stability dictates atherosclerotic plaque behavior. Its formation relies on embryonic signaling pathways (NOTCH, PDGF, TCF21), while its degradation stems from a imbalance between ECM synthesis and inflammation-driven breakdown. Therapeutic strategies targeting lipid reduction, inflammation, and SMC function aim to strengthen the cap and prevent rupture, underscoring its central role in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis.", "page_summaries": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrous_cap", "title": "Fibrous cap", "summary": "Fibrous cap - Wikipedia\n\n===============\n[Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrous_cap#bodyContent)\n\n- [x] Main menu \n\nMain menu\n\nmove to sidebar hide\n\n Navigation \n\n*   [Main page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"Visit the main page [alt-z]\")\n*   [Contents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents \"Guides to browsing Wikipedia\")\n*   [Current events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events \"Articles related to current events\")\n*   [Random article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random \"Visit a randomly selected article [alt-x]\")\n*   [About Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About \"Learn about Wikipedia and how it works\")\n*   [Contact us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us \"How to contact Wikipedia\")\n\n Contribute \n\n*   [Help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents \"Guidance on how to use and edit Wikipedia\")\n*   [Learn to edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction \"Learn how to edit Wikipedia\")\n*   [Community portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal \"The hub for editors\")\n*   [Recent changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges \"A list of recent changes to Wikipedia [alt-r]\")\n*   [Upload file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:File_upload_wizard \"Add images or other media for use on Wikipedia\")\n*   [Special pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:SpecialPages)\n\n[![Image 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png)![Image 2: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg)![Image 3: The Free Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)\n\n[Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search \"Search Wikipedia [alt-f]\")\n\nSearch\n\n- [x] Appearance \n\nAppearance\n\nmove to sidebar hide\n\nText\n\n*   Small  Standard  Large   \n\nThis page always uses small font size\n\nWidth\n\n*   Standard  Wide   \n\nThe content is as wide as possible for your browser window.\n\nColor (beta)\n\n*   Automatic  Light  Dark   \n\nThis page is always in light mode.\n\n*   [Donate](https://donate.wikimedia.org/?wmf_source=donate&wmf_medium=sidebar&wmf_campaign=en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en)\n*   [Create account](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Fibrous+cap \"You are encouraged to create an account and log in; however, it is not mandatory\")\n*   [Log in](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fibrous+cap \"You're encouraged to log in; however, it's not mandatory.

It's Monday, December 15. Our fundraiser will soon be over, but we're short of our goal. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If everyone who finds Wikipedia useful gave $2.75, we'd hit our goal in a few hours.\n\nAfter nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a nonprofit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.\n\nLess than 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today. If you are undecided, remember any contribution helps.\n\n25 years of the internet at its **best**\n\n How often would you like to donate? \n*   Once \n*   Monthly \n*   Annual \n\n Support Wikipedia year-round \n\n Thanks for your generous support \n\nPlease select an amount (USD)\n\nThe average donation in the United States is around$13.\n*   $2.75 \n*   $15 \n*   $25 Celebrate & Give 🎉 \n*   $50 \n*   $100 \n*   $250 \n*   $500 \n*   Other amount Other \n\n- [x] I'll generously add a little to cover the transaction fees so you can keep 100% of my donation. \n\n Please select a payment method \n\n![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/donate/b/be/Trustly_logos_only.png)Online Banking \n\nCredit / Debit Card \n\nContinue Donate  one time Donate  monthly Donate  annually\n\nPlease select an amount (minimum $1)\n\nWe cannot accept donations greater than 25000 USD through our website.

We manage funds and resources to ensure that every contribution supports our mission. We have earned the Platinum Seal of Transparency from Candid (formerly GuideStar), and Charity Navigator awarded us its highest rating. You can [read our most recent annual report](https://annual.wikimedia.org/) for more information about our financial health. \n\n45% Investment in Technology \nNearly half of our budget goes toward supporting the technology that powers Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. We are constantly working to enhance the user experience for both contributors and readers, improve site security, and ensure reliable access to our websites globally. This infrastructure and product support sustain one of the top ten most visited websites in the world, all at a fraction of the cost of popular for-profit websites.\n\n34% Support for Volunteers \nThe global reach of Wikimedia projects is made possible by the hard work of volunteers from across the globe. We provide grants, legal support, and other resources to help build vibrant volunteer communities. Additionally, we promote community engagement through outreach initiatives and advocate for the growth and protection of free knowledge.\n\n12% General and Administrative Expenses \nOperational costs are essential for the smooth management and governance of the Wikimedia Foundation. These expenses help us recruit top talent and support staff around the world, empowering them to carry out the mission of the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\n11% Allocation to Fundraising Efforts \nDonor support is crucial to sustaining Wikipedia and our other free knowledge endeavors. Our team is committed to efficient and effective fundraising throughout the year, ensuring that every contribution helps advance our mission.\n\nStill thinking about it?\n\nThe fact that you considered donating means a lot.

Cap rupture is the main cause of coronary thrombosis, leading to infarction and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the qualities of the cap are primary determinants of the clinical outcome of coronary and carotid atherosclerosis. In this mini-review, we discuss current knowledge about the formation of the fibrous cap, including cell recruitment, clonal expansion, and central molecular signaling pathways. We also examine the differences between mouse and human fibrous caps and explore the impact of anti-atherosclerotic therapies on the state of the fibrous cap. We propose that the cap should be understood as a neo-media to substitute for the original media that becomes separated from the surface endothelium during atherogenesis and that embryonic pathways involved in the development of the arteria media contribute to cap formation.\n\n**Keywords:** fibrous cap, atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, smooth muscle cells, clonal expansion, neomedia, arterial media development\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/)1. Introduction\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEach year, millions of deaths occur due to _plaque rupture_ of atherosclerotic lesions in arteries supplying the heart or brain ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B1)). Rupture occurs when the _fibrous cap_, which overlies a necrotic core, becomes too weak to withstand the forces of pulsatile blood flow, resulting in its breakage. The rupture may be large resulting in the expulsion of necrotic core material into the bloodstream or be limited to a small tear in the surface of plaques (sometimes called fissure) ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B2)). In both cases, the exposure of core material and collagens may activate thrombocytes and the coagulation system and lead to occluding thrombosis ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)) ([3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B3)).\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[![Image 1: Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3a7c/10475556/baf22358486a/fcvm-10-1254114-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10475556_fcvm-10-1254114-g001.jpg)\n\nStable vs. ruptured atherosclerotic plaque (**A**) and similarities between embryonic arterial media development and fibrous cap formation in atherosclerosis (**B**). (**A**) A simplified scheme depicting the media and neointima of a stable murine lesion with a thick collagen-rich fibrous cap overlying a necrotic core (left). The fibrous cap is highlighted by double or single dashed lines according to the first (i.e., space between the endothelium and the necrotic core) or the second definition (i.e., subendothelial SMCs), respectively. In contrast, lesions with thinner fibrous caps and large necrotic cores are at risk for rupturing and precipitating thrombosis (right). (**B**) NOTCH, PDGF, and TCF21 signaling control SMC recruitment and differentiation during mouse embryonic artery development (top) and fibrous cap formation in atherosclerosis (bottom). Mesenchymal precursor differentiation (either from the neural crest, mesoderm, or the epicardium) towards the SMC fate and away from other lineages (i.e., osteochondrocytes and fibroblasts) requires active PDGF and NOTCH signaling (ON) and silencing of TCF21 (OFF). Fibrous cap SMCs are primarily originated by migration and clonal expansion of medial SMCs and blockade of NOTCH, PDGF, or TCF21 signaling is sufficient to impair cap formation.\n\nStructurally, the fibrous cap in advanced plaque consists of layers of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) embedded in a collagen and elastin-rich matrix ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)). The cap SMCs express contractile proteins, such as ACTA2 (actin alpha 2, smooth muscle) and MYH11 (myosin heavy chain 11), but unlike SMCs of the healthy arterial media, the myofilaments are restricted to the cytoplasmic periphery, while the interior is occupied by an abundant endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies, consistent with active extracellular matrix production ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B4)).\n\nIn human pathology, the cap is often defined as the tissue that separates a necrotic core from the lumen ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B5)). This definition is meaningful considering the critical importance of this tissue for plaque stability. However, the accumulation of subendothelial SMCs is also found in regions of advanced plaque where no necrosis is present, and in experimental research in mouse models, the fibrous cap is often simply defined as the layer of ACTA2+ SMCs in the subendothelial space. It is helpful to bear in mind that these different definitions exist and are being used interchangeably in the literature on fibrous cap formation.\n\nAccording to the first definition of the cap, which refers to the tissue separating the necrotic core from the lumen, the cap of human plaques initially consists of the original intimal tissue. As lesions developed into fibroatheromas, this tissue is gradually replaced by a denser SMC-rich layer with more collagen ([6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B6)). The thickness of the cap tissue is the most important factor determining the risk of rupture, and coronary plaques rarely rupture if it is thicker than 65 µm ([7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B7)). In mouse models of atherosclerosis, the tissue separating the core from the lumen is often dominated by big macrophage foam cells ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)), and therefore, its thickness does not provide a clear measure of cap strength.\n\nBy the second definition of the cap, which defines it as the layer of subendothelial SMCs ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)), cap formation serves to restore the supportive layer of SMCs beneath the surface endothelium. This endothelial-SMC connection is present in normal arteries but is temporarily lost or challenged during plaque formation. Notably, the two definitions overlap in human fibroatheroma, the typical precursor of acute coronary events, as the tissue separating necrotic cores consists mainly of subendothelial SMCs and the matrix they produce. This brief review examines cap formation in the sense of the second definition.\n\nThe stability of atherosclerotic plaques relies on a delicate balance between the formation and degradation of the fibrous cap. Several previous reviews have focused on cap degradation resulting from SMC senescence and death ([8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B8)), as well as the breakdown of collagen and other extracellular matrix components ([9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B9)–[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B11)). Here, we examine the fibrous cap from the opposite perspective. We aim to provide an overview of the main mechanisms by which SMCs in experimental models are recruited to the subendothelial space and form the cap. Furthermore, we explore the overlap in underlying molecular mechanisms with embryonic artery development. Finally, we review the effects of therapies and interventions aimed at reducing atherosclerosis on the condition of the fibrous cap.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/)2. Mechanisms of cap formation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2.1. Clonal expansion of medial SMCs\n\nSMCs have been classically identified by the expression of contractile proteins defined as SMC lineage markers (e.g., MYH11, ACTA2). However, lineage tracing studies in the past decade have demonstrated that atherosclerotic plaques are dominated by cells with an SMC origin, which have lost the expression of canonical SMC markers ([12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B12)). These cells are commonly referred as SMC-derived cells.\n\nMulticolored SMC lineage-tracing reporters, such as Rosa26-Confetti or Rosa26-Rainbow mice combined with _Myh11_-Cre ERT2 or _Acta2_-Cre ERT2 mice, have been used to assess the clonal structure of SMCs investing into plaques ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B13)–[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B16)). In these models, labeled cells were found to be organized in large monochromatic patches indicating that SMC-derived plaque cells originate from a limited number of founder SMCs in the arterial media that clonally expand to populate the lesion ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B13), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B14)).\n\nEach of these founder SMCs possesses the plasticity to produce plaque cells with different phenotypes ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B13), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B14)): (i) cap SMCs, which are located in the subendothelial space and express contractile SMC proteins such as ACTA2; (ii) chondrocyte-like SMCs or chondromyocytes ([17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B17)), which may promote calcification in the plaque and express chondrocyte markers (SOX9, COL2A1); (iii) fibroblast-like SMCs or fibromyocytes ([18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B18)), which provide tensile strength and plaque stability by producing collagens and fibronectin and express fibroblast markers (LUM, BGN, DCN, OPG); and (iv) lipid-loaded SMCs or inflammatory SMCs ([14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B14)), which accumulate lipids and take part in the inflammatory state of the plaque by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Because these last SMC-derived cells show expression of myeloid markers such as CD68, some authors have speculated about smooth muscle-to-macrophage differentiation in the plaque ([19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B19)). However, there is a growing body of evidence challenging this theory ([18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B18), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B20)).\n\nMisra et al. found that a few medial SMCs migrate into the intima at the shoulder of the growing plaque, proliferate, and first give rise to fibrous cap SMCs that express ACTA2 and PDGFRB (platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta). Subsequently, cap SMCs produce progeny that migrate into the core, downregulate SMC lineage markers, and differentiate into alternative mesenchymal phenotypes that promote lesion growth ([15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B15)). Alencar et al. demonstrated that around two-thirds of SMC-derived cells express or have passed through a modulated state expressing LGALS3 (galectin 3) during their investment into the lesion. However, most cap SMCs do not pass through this intermediate stage ([21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B21)). Collectively, these findings suggest that cap SMCs originate from medial SMCs that migrate to the subendothelial space without passing through the highly modulated phenotypes characteristic of SMC-derived cells in the plaque interior.\n\nThe separation in pathways leading to cap SMCs and modulated SMC-derived cells has significant implications for anti-atherosclerotic therapies. Targeting the entire SMC population in atherosclerosis may compromise SMC investment into the fibrous cap, leading to reduced cap thickness, and increased risk of thrombotic complications ([15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B15), [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B22), [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B23)). However, strategies that target modulated SMC progeny in the lesion core could potentially represent a viable therapeutic approach, reducing plaque size without compromising fibrous cap integrity ([21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B21)). Therefore, identifying the mechanisms that determine different SMC fates in plaque and how interventions might affect the balance between plaque-stabilizing and plaque-destabilizing SMC states will be a key area for exploration in the future.\n\nIt should be noted that the mechanisms of cap formation in humans may differ from those of mice. Human lesions preferentially form in regions of the arterial tree where the arterial intima has a large pre-existing population of SMCs ([24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B24)). These intimal SMCs constitute the initial cap tissue and are the most likely sources of the fibrous cap throughout lesion development ([6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B6)). Furthermore, it remains unknown whether human cap SMCs, like murine, are the product of oligoclonal proliferation. Studies of X chromosome inactivation patterns in homogenates of micro-dissected plaques from women with heterozygous polymorphisms on X-encoded genes provided evidence that the SMC population in the cap contains large clones ([25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B25), [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B26)). However, subsequent studies found that such clones also exist in normal arteries raising the question of whether the clonal expansion occurs during artery development, physiological intimal thickening, or atherosclerosis ([26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B26), [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B27)). New approaches are needed to settle this question in upcoming years.\n\n### 2.2. Other cellular sources for cap SMCs\n\nCap SMCs in mice are primarily derived from local medial SMCs that undergo clonal expansion ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B13), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B14), [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B28)–[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B30)). However, when recruitment of medial SMCs is impaired, additional sources of cap SMCs may become quantitatively important, such as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition of surface endothelial cells ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31)). One may speculate that the existence of these alternative mechanisms would increase the resilience of the cap SMC layer to thinning, but the reality is that thin-cap fibroatheromas still form and cause clinical events ([7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B7)). This raises several questions: Do this alternative source of cap SMCs also contribute quantitatively to human fibrous caps? What are the cues necessary to initiate the transitioning process? Can it be forced to strengthen the fibrous cap and ultimately prevent plaque rupture? These are important questions for future research.\n\n### 2.3. Recapitulation of embryonic pathways in SMCs during atherosclerosis\n\nIn normal arteries, the endothelium is positioned adjacent to a supporting layer of medial SMCs, which provides mechanical stability to the wall and enables the endothelium to regulate arterial diameter for optimal blood flow. The accumulation of plaque material in the intima disrupts this symbiotic relationship. Being a layered SMC structure in the subendothelial space, it is reasonable to consider that the cap is essentially a neo-media that substitutes for the lost connection to the arterial media. This interpretation is supported by the finding that three embryonic artery developmental programs are reactivated to recruit SMCs to form the fibrous cap: NOTCH, PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), and TCF21 (transcription factor 21) signaling ([Figure 1B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)).\n\nEmbryonic medial SMC differentiation relies on Notch signaling, which guides local mesenchymal precursors toward adopting SMC fate while suppressing the osteochondrogenic program ([32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B32), [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B33)). In the development of the aortic arch, the expression of JAG1 (jagged canonical Notch ligand 1) on the endothelium triggers Notch signaling in neighboring neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells, initiating the formation of a subendothelial layer of SMCs in the maturing artery. The recruited SMCs themselves express JAG1 and can thereby propagate sequential waves of SMC differentiation leading to a multilayered arterial media ([33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B33)). Notably, JAG1 and NOTCH3 (the typical Notch receptor in SMCs) are also expressed in cap cells of human and murine fibroatheromas, suggesting that Notch signaling could orchestrate cap formation through a similar mechanism ([30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B30)). This was addressed in murine atherosclerosis by blocking Notch signaling in SMCs, which effectively reduced their ability to produce ACTA2 + cap SMCs ([30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B30)). Notably, loss of Notch signaling did not affect the total recruitment or SMC-derived cells in plaques or the modulation to other SMC-derived subtypes, and gain-of-function experiments indicated that reduced Notch signaling is even required for proliferation and phenotypic modulation in murine atherosclerosis ([30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B30)). Precise regulation of the Notch signaling cascade thus appears necessary to build the cap SMC population. This involves sequential loss of Notch signaling (for SMCs to exit the media, proliferate, and accumulate in the forming plaque) followed by a gain of Notch signaling (to acquire the SMC identity in the cap), in a process that bears similarities to arterial medial development.\n\nPDGF signaling is also key for the radial construction of the developing arterial wall in murine and avian embryos ([34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B34)–[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B36)). PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor subunit B), which is secreted by nascent endothelial tubes, recruits and stimulates PDGFRB + mural cell precursors to mature into successive layers of SMCs from the inside out. As the SMCs mature, the expression of PDGFRB is downregulated, and they acquire lineage SMC markers such as ACTA2, TAGLN (transgelin), and MYH11 ([34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B34)). Notably, PDGFRB is re-expressed in early cap SMCs in murine atherosclerotic plaques ([15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B15), [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B37)). PDGF acts as a chemoattractant and mitogen for SMCs ([38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B38), [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B39)), and persistent PDGF signaling through PDGFRB is necessary for SMC investment and retention within the fibrous cap ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31), [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B40)). Mechanistically, PDGF promotes SMC migration and transitioning to an extracellular matrix-synthetic state through metabolic reprogramming, thus playing a dual role in cap formation ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31), [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B39)). Blocking PDGF signaling leads to alternative sources of cap SMCs through an endothelial-to-mesenchymal-transition mechanism driven by IL1B (interleukin 1 beta) and TGFB (transforming growth factor beta). However, these alternative sources cannot sustain fibrous cap formation and maintenance within advanced atherosclerotic lesions ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31)), highlighting the relevance of the PDGF pathway for stable cap formation.\n\nTCF21 is a transcription factor that controls cell fate decisions in the developing epicardium. TCF21 shifts epicardial progenitor cells away from the SMC lineage and is switched off in coronary vascular SMCs, but persistently expressed in epicardium-derived cardiac fibroblasts ([41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B41), [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B42)). However, upon vascular injury, TCF21 is re-expressed in vascular wall SMC precursors and promotes SMC proliferation, migration, and phenotypic modulation towards a fibroblast gene expression program ([18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B18)). TCF21 + cells are found in the fibrous cap of advanced human and murine atherosclerotic lesions ([43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B43)). TCF21 inhibits SMC differentiation by blocking the myocardin-serum response factor pathway ([44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B44)). Deletion of TCF21 in the SMC lineage reduces its ability to undergo phenotypic switching and decreases the proportion of SMC lineage cells in the fibrous cap ([18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B18)). Altogether, TCF21 expression in the adult vascular wall might be a trait of a SMC precursor cell that, in a pathological setting, shifts SMCs away from their mature, contractile function towards a more fibroblast-like phenotype and contributes to forming the fibrous cap.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/)3. Impact of therapies on the fibrous cap\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTherapies that strengthen fibrous caps have been a clear goal for researchers since plaque rupture was discovered as the main underlying cause of myocardial infarction. [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#T1) shows a non-exhaustive list of current therapies and interventions in human or murine experimental models that have been reported to affect the fibrous cap thickness or SMC content. The targets are varied and include plasma cholesterol and glucose, SMCs, inflammation, the extracellular matrix, and cellular senescence.\n\n### Table 1.\n\nImpact of current therapies and

[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B46)) and SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibition ([47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B47)) may increase cap thickness (distance from lumen to a necrotic core). Whether this results from strengthening cap formation or less degradation is not known. Anti-inflammatory therapies, such as IL1B antagonism and colchicine, reduce the incidence of clinical events in patients with advanced atherosclerosis ([52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B52), [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B53)), but whether this is achieved partly by increasing cap thickness is also unknown. Curiously, inhibition of IL1B in murine atherosclerosis inhibited cap formation ([48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B48)). If this effect is conserved in human atherosclerosis, it could partly offset the beneficial effect of dampening macrophage-driven inflammation. Another potential modifier of fibrous cap thickness in patients is imatinib, which is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia that inhibits PDGFRB and limits cap formation in mice ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31)).\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/)4. Discussion\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCells deriving from SMCs have complex roles in atherosclerosis driving plaque growth through modulation and proliferation and stabilizing the formed plaque by forming the fibrous cap. More research into the mechanisms that control the fate decisions of SMC-derived cells is needed to inform the development of therapies that can reduce plaque growth without jeopardizing the mechanical resilience of the plaque to rupture.\n\nRecent findings in animal models suggest that the fibrous cap forms by a process resembling arterial media development. First, the cap has the structure of a media, consisting of layers of SMCs with contractile protein expression that provide mechanical support for the plaque endothelium. Therefore, the fibrous cap of atherosclerotic lesions may be thought of as a neo-media, restoring the junction between the SMCs and the endothelium that is temporarily lost in early atherosclerosis due to the accumulation of lipids and inflammatory cells in the arterial intima.

The size of the LRNC is associated with fibrous cap thinning and disruption.46,88 Fibrous cap rupture initiates the [thromboembolic process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/thromboembolism \"Learn more about thromboembolic process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") from exposure of underlying thrombogenic plaque contents to flowing blood, leading to stroke. Both fibrous cap status and LRNC volume are therefore good indicators of plaque stability.69,74,89\n\nFibrous cap can be assessed with VWI better than with CT and US.59,90,91 In stable atherosclerotic plaques, a thick fibrous cap can be depicted as a thick and regular juxtaluminal band of low signal intensity on TOF and high signal intensity on CE T1-weighted VWI (Fig.6). The detection of thin fibrous cap is more challenging and often requires the use of a dedicated carotid coil. Fibrous cap thinning can be suggested if the fibrous cap cannot be visualized on TOF or CE T1-weighted VWI. Fibrous cap rupture can also be depicted and is suspected when the fibrous cap is thin or not visible and a focal region of intermediate-to-high signal is present adjacent to the lumen (corresponding to thrombus).15,92 Both 1.5 T and 3T scanners allow for the assessment of the fibrous cap, though 3T is preferred.17\n\n![Image 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1064968923000272-gr6.jpg)\n\nFig.6.

Thickness of the FC can be determined with a 73% sensitivity and 67% specificity using stratified GSM measurements.21 Ultrasonic backscatter (IBS) was found to be lower in the thin FC compared with the thick FC.22\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588415005419)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588415005419\n\n### Fibrous cap\n\nFibrous cap[atheromas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/atheroma \"Learn more about atheromas from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") are defined as plaques with a well-defined lipid core covered by a fibrous cap, which may be relatively acellular (made of dense collagen) or may be rich in smooth cells. No data in autopsy studies are available regarding the prevalence of fibrous caps of various thickness. Stenosis severity is directly related to the proportion of dense fibrous tissue (type I collagen) in the fibrous cap, and inversely related to smooth-muscle-cell–rich areas (2–4).\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109703003590)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109703003590\n\n### Thin Fibrous Cap\n\nThe fibrous cap is made up of intimal [smooth muscle cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/smooth-muscle-cell \"Learn more about smooth muscle cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and connective tissue. Fibrous tissue has short T1, which results in bright signal on T1-weighted images and contrast enhancement. Rupture-prone plaques are very thin (65 to 150 µm), which is below the spatial resolution of MRI. In three-dimensional time of flight, the fibrous cap is seen at the interface of the bright lumen and dark wall,13 making it possible to assess its integrity (Fig. 28-2).14 Higher strength magnets and multiple-channel coils may be necessary for further characterization. Easy visualization of a cap on MRI generally indicates that it is relatively thick. Nonvisualization (implying a thin cap) or disruption of the fibrous cap indicates potentially high risk plaques (Fig. 28-3).\n\n[Read full chapter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437713664000287)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437713664000287\n\n### Relevance of the fibrous cap for atherosclerosis imaging\n\nA common mechanism of disruption of the fibrous cap[atheroma](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/atheroma \"Learn more about atheroma from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") occurs via the thinning and weakening of the fibrous cap, resulting in breaks exposing [tissue factor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/thromboplastin \"Learn more about tissue factor from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and with subsequent thrombosis and [vasospasm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vasospasm \"Learn more about vasospasm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). A fibrous cap has been defined as thin when it is less than 65 microns in its minimum thickness. This is based upon a study showing that the thickness of the fibrous cap in most (95%) acute plaque ruptures was less than this (21). Kolodgie et al. (39)demonstrated that the mean numbers of thin cap [atheromas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/atheroma \"Learn more about atheromas from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), as so defined, was greater than or equal to 1.5 in patients dying with [acute MI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acute-heart-infarction \"Learn more about acute MI from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and/or acute plaque rupture, between 1 and 1.4 (mean 1.1 ± 1.3) in patients dying with stable plaque, and least common in patients without acute rupture (0.9 ± 1.2), healed rupture (0.5 ± 0.8), or plaque erosion (0.2 ± 0.5). Thin-cap atheromas are more frequent in men dying with acute MI and sudden death. Their distribution in the coronary tree mirrors that of acute plaque rupture. The mean necrotic core size and core length of thin-cap atheromas are, however, smaller than in plaques that rupture, and not significantly greater than fibrous cap atheromas with a thicker cap (32)(Table 2).\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109703003590)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109703003590\n\nFibrous caps are thinnest at the shoulders of the lesion, that is at the junction of the fibrous cap with adjacent, more normal intima [45]. This region is often heavily infiltrated with [foam cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/foam-cell \"Learn more about foam cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")[45,50]. Early during development of the fibrous cap, [smooth muscle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/smooth-muscle \"Learn more about smooth muscle from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") cells are present in significant numbers [27,29] but as the lesion progresses there is a steady decline in numbers [51,78]. Smooth muscle cells could vanish as a result of [programmed cell death](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/programmed-cell-death \"Learn more about programmed cell death from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or [apoptosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/programmed-cell-death \"Learn more about apoptosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")[52,53].

The absence of this band can indicate either a ruptured or a thin FC. Differentiation between the last two still remains a significant challenge.45 However, a 3D multiple overlapping thin slab protocol may be capable of distinguishing the thick intact FC from the intact thin and ruptured FC.50\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588415005419)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588415005419\n\n### 4.3 Thin cap fibroatheroma (TCFA)\n\nThe fibrous cap represents the portion of the plaque that faces the vascular lumen and maintains the integrity of the plaque. Thinning of the fibrous cap is considered an independent risk for acute ischemic events and leads to plaque rupture [64]. The critical thickness of a fibrous cap prone to rupture is nearly three times greater for carotid than for coronary plaques (72±15 vs. 23±17 microns) [65], suggesting a possibility for early detection by MRI scanning [66]. It has been suggested that the fibrous cap is thinned by autolysis via the action of [metalloproteinase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/metalloproteinase \"Learn more about metalloproteinase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") released by macrophages [67].\n\nIn [coronary arteries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/coronary-artery \"Learn more about coronary arteries from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), [OCT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/optical-coherence-tomography \"Learn more about OCT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") enables identification of TCFA [68] (Fig.6). IVUS-derived TCFA is defined as plaque burden of ≥40% with a confluent necrotic core >10% in direct contact with the lumen. In contrast, MRI with delayed [gadolinium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gadolinium \"Learn more about gadolinium from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (Gd) clearance has been shown to accurately detect TCFA [69]. Direct comparison of [endarterectomy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/endarterectomy \"Learn more about endarterectomy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") studies showed that Gd retention, due to inflammation, primarily occurred in regions with TCFA <60 μm. Sano et al. [70] used [IVUS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/intravascular-ultrasound \"Learn more about IVUS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to investigate 160 non-significant coronary lesions in 140 patients with angina, who were followed up for 30 months. Of the 12 plaques which ruptured, generating [ACS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acute-coronary-syndrome \"Learn more about ACS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), all proved to have baseline thin TCFA, significantly greater RI and higher percentage of lipid pool area.

[66] in the [carotid circulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/carotid-artery-flow \"Learn more about carotid circulation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), which showed an increased occurrence of subsequent [neurological complications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neurological-complication \"Learn more about neurological complications from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") over a mean follow up period of 38 months.\n\n![Image 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0021915013005960-gr6.jpg)\n\nFig.6.

The defining feature of this lesion is a lipid-rich necrotic core encapsulated by fibrous tissue (Fig.2). Fibrous cap atheroma may result in significant luminal narrowing and is also prone to the complications of surface disruption, thrombosis, and calcification. Knowledge of the origin and development of the core is fundamental in understanding the progression of atherosclerotic disease; the question of how lesions convert from lipid-rich pools within pathologic [intimal thickening](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/artery-intima-proliferation \"Learn more about intimal thickening from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), to plaques with true necrosis (necrotic core), presents one of the most challenging issues in the field today.\n\n![Image 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1052514907000202-gr2.jpg)\n\nFig.2.

These findings suggest that plaque rupture is determined by fibrous cap thickness, and a combination of large plaque burden and luminal narrowing result in ACS (12).\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109714075068)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109714075068"}, {"url": "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16753-atherosclerosis-arterial-disease", "title": "What’s Clogging Your Arteries?", "summary": "Atherosclerosis is the gradual buildup of plaque (composed of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances) in arterial walls, leading to arterial hardening and narrowing.

As they report in[_Circulation Journal_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982788),their observations have prompted them to reconsider the mechanisms of plaque rupture and which patients are at high risk of acute coronary syndromes.\n\nStudy Methodology\n-----------------\n\nThe researchers selected 23 patients with STEMI caused by plaque rupture from the Mass General OCT Registry, a data set of patients who have undergone OCT of the coronary arteries at 20 sites across six countries, and identified 27 non-culprit lesions in the culprit vessels. Non-culprit lesions were defined as plaques seen on coronary angiogram that had not been treated, with a diameter stenosis of >30% on OCT examination.\n\nAn additional 23 SA patients with 27 non-culprit plaques were matched to the STEMI patients by age and gender. With the aid of the computer algorithm, the researchers segmented FC boundaries in each frame of the OCT images. Next, the FCT at every point of the cap boundary was determined, and the FCT area per plaque was summed and classified using one of three categories: <80 μm (defined as TCFA), 80–200 μm or >200 μm.\n\nPatterns of TCFA\n----------------\n\nThe 3-D analysis showed that TCFAs were dispersed throughout the plaques, creating multiple weak areas. This pattern was especially notable in STEMI patients, who had an almost three-fold greater number of TCFAs, as well as a three-fold larger surface area in individual TCFA as compared to SA patients. Significantly, patients with STEMI had a larger area of FCT <200 μm and a smaller area of FCT >200 μm, as compared to SA patients. Moreover, the researchers showed that even in patients with STEMI, there is great variability in both the number of TCFAs as well as the size of the largest single TCFA.\n\nResearch Implications\n---------------------\n\nThe researchers suggest that plaque vulnerability may not depend on the single-point thickness of FC, as measured in current practice, but rather on the largest area of thin FC or even the sum of several TCFAs located near each other.\n\nThe data also suggest, the research team says, that changes in the whole FC pattern may be a better indicator of response to treatment and risk of future cardiovascular events than FCT measured at a single location.\n\n[view original journal article _Subscription may be required_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982788)\n\n[Circulation Journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982788)\n\nJournal Article Published: April 13, 2019\n\nLearn more about [Mass General's Division of Cardiology](https://www.massgeneral.org/cardiology/)\n\nRefer a patient to the [Mass General Heart Center](https://www.massgeneral.org/heart-center/appointments-and-referrals/)"}], "from_cache": false}}, "actual_hops": 5, "success": true, "id": 5}

Symptoms of complications may include chest pain (angina), sudden numbness/weakness, trouble speaking, or vision loss, requiring emergency medical attention."}], "from_cache": true}, "fibrous cap": {"final_description": "The **fibrous cap** is a specialized layer of fibrous connective tissue that forms a critical structural component of atherosclerotic plaques, separating the plaque's thrombogenic core (rich in lipids, necrotic debris, and inflammatory cells) from the arterial lumen. Its integrity is a primary determinant of plaque stability, with disruption or thinning strongly associated with acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. \n\n### Structure and Composition  \nThe fibrous cap is characterized by a dense extracellular matrix (ECM) rich in collagen (predominantly type I) and elastin, synthesized primarily by smooth muscle cells (SMCs). It contains variable numbers of SMCs, macrophages, foam cells, and lymphocytes, with SMCs playing a central role in maintaining structural integrity through ECM production. In stable plaques, the cap is thick (>200 μm), cellular, and collagen-rich, whereas \"vulnerable\" plaques exhibit thinning (<65–150 μm) and reduced SMC density, often with increased macrophage infiltration and ECM degradation. The cap is thinnest at the plaque \"shoulders\" (junction with normal intima), a region prone to rupture due to mechanical stress and high inflammatory cell density.\n\n### Formation and Cellular Origins  \nFibrous cap formation involves the recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of SMCs, primarily derived from the arterial media. Lineage tracing studies in murine models demonstrate that medial SMCs migrate into the intima, undergo clonal expansion, and differentiate into \"cap SMCs\" that express contractile proteins (e.g., ACTA2, MYH11) and produce ECM. These SMCs may adopt diverse phenotypes, including collagen-synthetic (fibromyocytes), lipid-laden (inflammatory SMCs), or chondrocyte-like (calcifying) subtypes. In humans, pre-existing intimal SMCs may also contribute to cap formation, particularly in early lesions. Alternative sources, such as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) of endothelial cells, play a minor role under normal conditions but may be activated when medial SMC recruitment is impaired.  \n\nKey signaling pathways regulating cap formation recapitulate embryonic arterial development:  \n- **NOTCH signaling**: Promotes SMC differentiation and suppresses osteochondrogenic fate, with JAG1/Notch3 activation driving SMC recruitment to the subendothelial space.  \n- **PDGF signaling**: PDGFB/PDGFRB activation stimulates SMC migration, proliferation, and ECM synthesis, critical for cap retention and thickness.  \n- **TCF21 signaling**: Inhibits SMC differentiation, shifting progenitors toward fibroblast-like phenotypes; its downregulation is required for mature cap SMC formation.  \n\n### Clinical Significance: Vulnerability and Rupture  \nPlaque rupture, the leading cause of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and stroke, occurs when mechanical stress (e.g., pulsatile blood flow) exceeds the cap's tensile strength. Thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFAs)—defined by a cap thickness <65 μm, large lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), and heavy macrophage infiltration—are the primary precursors of rupture. Rupture exposes thrombogenic core contents (e.g., tissue factor) to flowing blood, triggering thrombus formation and luminal occlusion. Autopsy studies show 95% of acute ruptures occur in TCFAs, with cap thickness inversely correlated with rupture risk.  \n\n3D volumetric analyses reveal TCFAs are often dispersed throughout plaques, creating multiple weak points rather than a single \"vulnerable\" region. STEMI patients exhibit more extensive TCFA burden (greater number, larger total area) compared to stable angina patients, highlighting the role of cumulative cap fragility in clinical events.  \n\n### Imaging and Assessment  \nThe fibrous cap is best evaluated using advanced imaging modalities:  \n- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: Provides high-resolution (10–20 μm) visualization of cap thickness, rupture, and luminal surface irregularities. TCFA is defined by OCT as a cap <65 μm with underlying LRNC.  \n- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Using vessel wall imaging (VWI), stable caps appear as thick, hypointense juxtaluminal bands on time-of-flight (TOF) sequences and enhance with gadolinium; thin/ruptured caps show absent or disrupted enhancement.  \n- **Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)**: Detects TCFA by identifying low echogenicity (LRNC) in direct contact with the lumen, though resolution is lower than OCT.  \n\n### Therapeutic Modulation  \nStrategies to stabilize the fibrous cap focus on enhancing SMC function, reducing inflammation, and promoting ECM synthesis:  \n- **Lipid-lowering therapies**: Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors (e.g., evolocumab) increase cap thickness by reducing LDL-driven inflammation and promoting SMC collagen production. In ACS patients, statins increase coronary cap thickness by ~20% within 6 months.  \n- **Anti-inflammatory agents**: IL-1β inhibitors (e.g., canakinumab) reduce macrophage infiltration but may impair SMC recruitment in murine models, requiring careful balancing of anti-inflammatory and pro-stabilization effects.  \n- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: In diabetic patients, these agents (e.g., empagliflozin) improve cap thickness by reducing oxidative stress and enhancing ECM integrity.  \n- **Targeted signaling modulators**: PDGFRB agonists may enhance SMC migration, while Notch activators could promote SMC differentiation, though clinical translation is ongoing.  \n\nConversely, therapies inhibiting PDGFRB (e.g., imatinib) or Notch signaling reduce cap thickness in animal models, potentially increasing rupture risk.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nThe fibrous cap is a dynamic structure whose stability depends on a balance between SMC-mediated ECM synthesis and inflammatory/proteolytic degradation. Its thickness, cellular composition, and spatial distribution are critical determinants of atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability. Advances in imaging and therapeutic targeting of cap-stabilizing pathways (e.g., NOTCH, PDGF) hold promise for reducing acute cardiovascular events by preserving cap integrity. Understanding the cap as a \"neo-media\"—recapitulating embryonic arterial development—provides a framework for developing novel strategies to prevent plaque rupture.", "page_summaries": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrous_cap", "title": "Fibrous cap", "summary": "Fibrous cap - Wikipedia\n\n===============\n[Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrous_cap#bodyContent)\n\n- [x] Main menu \n\nMain menu\n\nmove to sidebar hide\n\n Navigation \n\n*   [Main page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"Visit the main page [alt-z]\")\n*   [Contents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents \"Guides to browsing Wikipedia\")\n*   [Current events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events \"Articles related to current events\")\n*   [Random article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random \"Visit a randomly selected article [alt-x]\")\n*   [About Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About \"Learn about Wikipedia and how it works\")\n*   [Contact us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us \"How to contact Wikipedia\")\n\n Contribute \n\n*   [Help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents \"Guidance on how to use and edit Wikipedia\")\n*   [Learn to edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction \"Learn how to edit Wikipedia\")\n*   [Community portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal \"The hub for editors\")\n*   [Recent changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges \"A list of recent changes to Wikipedia [alt-r]\")\n*   [Upload file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:File_upload_wizard \"Add images or other media for use on Wikipedia\")\n*   [Special pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:SpecialPages)\n\n[![Image 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png)![Image 2: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg)![Image 3: The Free Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)\n\n[Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search \"Search Wikipedia [alt-f]\")\n\nSearch\n\n- [x] Appearance \n\nAppearance\n\nmove to sidebar hide\n\nText\n\n*   Small  Standard  Large   \n\nThis page always uses small font size\n\nWidth\n\n*   Standard  Wide   \n\nThe content is as wide as possible for your browser window.\n\nColor (beta)\n\n*   Automatic  Light  Dark   \n\nThis page is always in light mode.\n\n*   [Donate](https://donate.wikimedia.org/?wmf_source=donate&wmf_medium=sidebar&wmf_campaign=en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en)\n*   [Create account](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Fibrous+cap \"You are encouraged to create an account and log in; however, it is not mandatory\")\n*   [Log in](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fibrous+cap \"You're encouraged to log in; however, it's not mandatory.

The size of the LRNC is associated with fibrous cap thinning and disruption.46,88 Fibrous cap rupture initiates the [thromboembolic process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/thromboembolism \"Learn more about thromboembolic process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") from exposure of underlying thrombogenic plaque contents to flowing blood, leading to stroke. Both fibrous cap status and LRNC volume are therefore good indicators of plaque stability.69,74,89\n\nFibrous cap can be assessed with VWI better than with CT and US.59,90,91 In stable atherosclerotic plaques, a thick fibrous cap can be depicted as a thick and regular juxtaluminal band of low signal intensity on TOF and high signal intensity on CE T1-weighted VWI (Fig.6). The detection of thin fibrous cap is more challenging and often requires the use of a dedicated carotid coil. Fibrous cap thinning can be suggested if the fibrous cap cannot be visualized on TOF or CE T1-weighted VWI. Fibrous cap rupture can also be depicted and is suspected when the fibrous cap is thin or not visible and a focal region of intermediate-to-high signal is present adjacent to the lumen (corresponding to thrombus).15,92 Both 1.5 T and 3T scanners allow for the assessment of the fibrous cap, though 3T is preferred.17\n\n![Image 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1064968923000272-gr6.jpg)\n\nFig.6.

Thickness of the FC can be determined with a 73% sensitivity and 67% specificity using stratified GSM measurements.21 Ultrasonic backscatter (IBS) was found to be lower in the thin FC compared with the thick FC.22\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588415005419)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588415005419\n\n### Fibrous cap\n\nFibrous cap[atheromas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/atheroma \"Learn more about atheromas from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") are defined as plaques with a well-defined lipid core covered by a fibrous cap, which may be relatively acellular (made of dense collagen) or may be rich in smooth cells. No data in autopsy studies are available regarding the prevalence of fibrous caps of various thickness. Stenosis severity is directly related to the proportion of dense fibrous tissue (type I collagen) in the fibrous cap, and inversely related to smooth-muscle-cell–rich areas (2–4).\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109703003590)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109703003590\n\n### Thin Fibrous Cap\n\nThe fibrous cap is made up of intimal [smooth muscle cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/smooth-muscle-cell \"Learn more about smooth muscle cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and connective tissue. Fibrous tissue has short T1, which results in bright signal on T1-weighted images and contrast enhancement. Rupture-prone plaques are very thin (65 to 150 µm), which is below the spatial resolution of MRI. In three-dimensional time of flight, the fibrous cap is seen at the interface of the bright lumen and dark wall,13 making it possible to assess its integrity (Fig. 28-2).14 Higher strength magnets and multiple-channel coils may be necessary for further characterization. Easy visualization of a cap on MRI generally indicates that it is relatively thick. Nonvisualization (implying a thin cap) or disruption of the fibrous cap indicates potentially high risk plaques (Fig. 28-3).\n\n[Read full chapter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437713664000287)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437713664000287\n\n### Relevance of the fibrous cap for atherosclerosis imaging\n\nA common mechanism of disruption of the fibrous cap[atheroma](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/atheroma \"Learn more about atheroma from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") occurs via the thinning and weakening of the fibrous cap, resulting in breaks exposing [tissue factor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/thromboplastin \"Learn more about tissue factor from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and with subsequent thrombosis and [vasospasm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vasospasm \"Learn more about vasospasm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). A fibrous cap has been defined as thin when it is less than 65 microns in its minimum thickness. This is based upon a study showing that the thickness of the fibrous cap in most (95%) acute plaque ruptures was less than this (21). Kolodgie et al. (39)demonstrated that the mean numbers of thin cap [atheromas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/atheroma \"Learn more about atheromas from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), as so defined, was greater than or equal to 1.5 in patients dying with [acute MI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acute-heart-infarction \"Learn more about acute MI from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and/or acute plaque rupture, between 1 and 1.4 (mean 1.1 ± 1.3) in patients dying with stable plaque, and least common in patients without acute rupture (0.9 ± 1.2), healed rupture (0.5 ± 0.8), or plaque erosion (0.2 ± 0.5). Thin-cap atheromas are more frequent in men dying with acute MI and sudden death. Their distribution in the coronary tree mirrors that of acute plaque rupture. The mean necrotic core size and core length of thin-cap atheromas are, however, smaller than in plaques that rupture, and not significantly greater than fibrous cap atheromas with a thicker cap (32)(Table 2).\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109703003590)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109703003590\n\nFibrous caps are thinnest at the shoulders of the lesion, that is at the junction of the fibrous cap with adjacent, more normal intima [45]. This region is often heavily infiltrated with [foam cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/foam-cell \"Learn more about foam cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")[45,50]. Early during development of the fibrous cap, [smooth muscle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/smooth-muscle \"Learn more about smooth muscle from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") cells are present in significant numbers [27,29] but as the lesion progresses there is a steady decline in numbers [51,78]. Smooth muscle cells could vanish as a result of [programmed cell death](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/programmed-cell-death \"Learn more about programmed cell death from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or [apoptosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/programmed-cell-death \"Learn more about apoptosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")[52,53]. It has been shown that cellular and calcified caps are up to five times stiffer than hypocellular caps [54].\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915099004797)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915099004797\n\n### Fibrous cap\n\nOn MRI the FC appears as a juxtaluminal band, which is hypointense at TOF weightings and isointense at T1, T2, and proton density weightings. The absence of this band can indicate either a ruptured or a thin FC. Differentiation between the last two still remains a significant challenge.45 However, a 3D multiple overlapping thin slab protocol may be capable of distinguishing the thick intact FC from the intact thin and ruptured FC.50\n\n[Read full article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588415005419)\n\nURL:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588415005419\n\n### 4.3 Thin cap fibroatheroma (TCFA)\n\nThe fibrous cap represents the portion of the plaque that faces the vascular lumen and maintains the integrity of the plaque. Thinning of the fibrous cap is considered an independent risk for acute ischemic events and leads to plaque rupture [64]. The critical thickness of a fibrous cap prone to rupture is nearly three times greater for carotid than for coronary plaques (72±15 vs. 23±17 microns) [65], suggesting a possibility for early detection by MRI scanning [66]. It has been suggested that the fibrous cap is thinned by autolysis via the action of [metalloproteinase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/metalloproteinase \"Learn more about metalloproteinase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") released by macrophages [67].\n\nIn [coronary arteries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/coronary-artery \"Learn more about coronary arteries from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), [OCT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/optical-coherence-tomography \"Learn more about OCT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") enables identification of TCFA [68] (Fig.6). IVUS-derived TCFA is defined as plaque burden of ≥40% with a confluent necrotic core >10% in direct contact with the lumen. In contrast, MRI with delayed [gadolinium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gadolinium \"Learn more about gadolinium from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (Gd) clearance has been shown to accurately detect TCFA [69]. Direct comparison of [endarterectomy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/endarterectomy \"Learn more about endarterectomy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") studies showed that Gd retention, due to inflammation, primarily occurred in regions with TCFA <60 μm. Sano et al. [70] used [IVUS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/intravascular-ultrasound \"Learn more about IVUS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to investigate 160 non-significant coronary lesions in 140 patients with angina, who were followed up for 30 months. Of the 12 plaques which ruptured, generating [ACS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acute-coronary-syndrome \"Learn more about ACS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), all proved to have baseline thin TCFA, significantly greater RI and higher percentage of lipid pool area. Similar results have been reproduced by Takaya et al. [66] in the [carotid circulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/carotid-artery-flow \"Learn more about carotid circulation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), which showed an increased occurrence of subsequent [neurological complications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neurological-complication \"Learn more about neurological complications from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") over a mean follow up period of 38 months.\n\n![Image 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0021915013005960-gr6.jpg)\n\nFig.6.

The defining feature of this lesion is a lipid-rich necrotic core encapsulated by fibrous tissue (Fig.2). Fibrous cap atheroma may result in significant luminal narrowing and is also prone to the complications of surface disruption, thrombosis, and calcification. Knowledge of the origin and development of the core is fundamental in understanding the progression of atherosclerotic disease; the question of how lesions convert from lipid-rich pools within pathologic [intimal thickening](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/artery-intima-proliferation \"Learn more about intimal thickening from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), to plaques with true necrosis (necrotic core), presents one of the most challenging issues in the field today.\n\n![Image 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1052514907000202-gr2.jpg)\n\nFig.2.

Cap rupture is the main cause of coronary thrombosis, leading to infarction and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the qualities of the cap are primary determinants of the clinical outcome of coronary and carotid atherosclerosis. In this mini-review, we discuss current knowledge about the formation of the fibrous cap, including cell recruitment, clonal expansion, and central molecular signaling pathways. We also examine the differences between mouse and human fibrous caps and explore the impact of anti-atherosclerotic therapies on the state of the fibrous cap. We propose that the cap should be understood as a neo-media to substitute for the original media that becomes separated from the surface endothelium during atherogenesis and that embryonic pathways involved in the development of the arteria media contribute to cap formation.\n\n**Keywords:** fibrous cap, atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, smooth muscle cells, clonal expansion, neomedia, arterial media development\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/)1. Introduction\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEach year, millions of deaths occur due to _plaque rupture_ of atherosclerotic lesions in arteries supplying the heart or brain ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B1)). Rupture occurs when the _fibrous cap_, which overlies a necrotic core, becomes too weak to withstand the forces of pulsatile blood flow, resulting in its breakage. The rupture may be large resulting in the expulsion of necrotic core material into the bloodstream or be limited to a small tear in the surface of plaques (sometimes called fissure) ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B2)). In both cases, the exposure of core material and collagens may activate thrombocytes and the coagulation system and lead to occluding thrombosis ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)) ([3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B3)).\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[![Image 1: Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3a7c/10475556/baf22358486a/fcvm-10-1254114-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10475556_fcvm-10-1254114-g001.jpg)\n\nStable vs. ruptured atherosclerotic plaque (**A**) and similarities between embryonic arterial media development and fibrous cap formation in atherosclerosis (**B**). (**A**) A simplified scheme depicting the media and neointima of a stable murine lesion with a thick collagen-rich fibrous cap overlying a necrotic core (left). The fibrous cap is highlighted by double or single dashed lines according to the first (i.e., space between the endothelium and the necrotic core) or the second definition (i.e., subendothelial SMCs), respectively. In contrast, lesions with thinner fibrous caps and large necrotic cores are at risk for rupturing and precipitating thrombosis (right). (**B**) NOTCH, PDGF, and TCF21 signaling control SMC recruitment and differentiation during mouse embryonic artery development (top) and fibrous cap formation in atherosclerosis (bottom). Mesenchymal precursor differentiation (either from the neural crest, mesoderm, or the epicardium) towards the SMC fate and away from other lineages (i.e., osteochondrocytes and fibroblasts) requires active PDGF and NOTCH signaling (ON) and silencing of TCF21 (OFF). Fibrous cap SMCs are primarily originated by migration and clonal expansion of medial SMCs and blockade of NOTCH, PDGF, or TCF21 signaling is sufficient to impair cap formation.\n\nStructurally, the fibrous cap in advanced plaque consists of layers of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) embedded in a collagen and elastin-rich matrix ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)). The cap SMCs express contractile proteins, such as ACTA2 (actin alpha 2, smooth muscle) and MYH11 (myosin heavy chain 11), but unlike SMCs of the healthy arterial media, the myofilaments are restricted to the cytoplasmic periphery, while the interior is occupied by an abundant endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies, consistent with active extracellular matrix production ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B4)).\n\nIn human pathology, the cap is often defined as the tissue that separates a necrotic core from the lumen ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B5)). This definition is meaningful considering the critical importance of this tissue for plaque stability. However, the accumulation of subendothelial SMCs is also found in regions of advanced plaque where no necrosis is present, and in experimental research in mouse models, the fibrous cap is often simply defined as the layer of ACTA2+ SMCs in the subendothelial space. It is helpful to bear in mind that these different definitions exist and are being used interchangeably in the literature on fibrous cap formation.\n\nAccording to the first definition of the cap, which refers to the tissue separating the necrotic core from the lumen, the cap of human plaques initially consists of the original intimal tissue. As lesions developed into fibroatheromas, this tissue is gradually replaced by a denser SMC-rich layer with more collagen ([6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B6)). The thickness of the cap tissue is the most important factor determining the risk of rupture, and coronary plaques rarely rupture if it is thicker than 65 µm ([7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B7)). In mouse models of atherosclerosis, the tissue separating the core from the lumen is often dominated by big macrophage foam cells ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)), and therefore, its thickness does not provide a clear measure of cap strength.\n\nBy the second definition of the cap, which defines it as the layer of subendothelial SMCs ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)), cap formation serves to restore the supportive layer of SMCs beneath the surface endothelium. This endothelial-SMC connection is present in normal arteries but is temporarily lost or challenged during plaque formation. Notably, the two definitions overlap in human fibroatheroma, the typical precursor of acute coronary events, as the tissue separating necrotic cores consists mainly of subendothelial SMCs and the matrix they produce. This brief review examines cap formation in the sense of the second definition.\n\nThe stability of atherosclerotic plaques relies on a delicate balance between the formation and degradation of the fibrous cap. Several previous reviews have focused on cap degradation resulting from SMC senescence and death ([8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B8)), as well as the breakdown of collagen and other extracellular matrix components ([9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B9)–[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B11)). Here, we examine the fibrous cap from the opposite perspective. We aim to provide an overview of the main mechanisms by which SMCs in experimental models are recruited to the subendothelial space and form the cap. Furthermore, we explore the overlap in underlying molecular mechanisms with embryonic artery development. Finally, we review the effects of therapies and interventions aimed at reducing atherosclerosis on the condition of the fibrous cap.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/)2. Mechanisms of cap formation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2.1. Clonal expansion of medial SMCs\n\nSMCs have been classically identified by the expression of contractile proteins defined as SMC lineage markers (e.g., MYH11, ACTA2). However, lineage tracing studies in the past decade have demonstrated that atherosclerotic plaques are dominated by cells with an SMC origin, which have lost the expression of canonical SMC markers ([12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B12)). These cells are commonly referred as SMC-derived cells.\n\nMulticolored SMC lineage-tracing reporters, such as Rosa26-Confetti or Rosa26-Rainbow mice combined with _Myh11_-Cre ERT2 or _Acta2_-Cre ERT2 mice, have been used to assess the clonal structure of SMCs investing into plaques ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B13)–[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B16)). In these models, labeled cells were found to be organized in large monochromatic patches indicating that SMC-derived plaque cells originate from a limited number of founder SMCs in the arterial media that clonally expand to populate the lesion ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B13), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B14)).\n\nEach of these founder SMCs possesses the plasticity to produce plaque cells with different phenotypes ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B13), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B14)): (i) cap SMCs, which are located in the subendothelial space and express contractile SMC proteins such as ACTA2; (ii) chondrocyte-like SMCs or chondromyocytes ([17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B17)), which may promote calcification in the plaque and express chondrocyte markers (SOX9, COL2A1); (iii) fibroblast-like SMCs or fibromyocytes ([18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B18)), which provide tensile strength and plaque stability by producing collagens and fibronectin and express fibroblast markers (LUM, BGN, DCN, OPG); and (iv) lipid-loaded SMCs or inflammatory SMCs ([14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B14)), which accumulate lipids and take part in the inflammatory state of the plaque by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Because these last SMC-derived cells show expression of myeloid markers such as CD68, some authors have speculated about smooth muscle-to-macrophage differentiation in the plaque ([19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B19)). However, there is a growing body of evidence challenging this theory ([18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B18), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B20)).\n\nMisra et al. found that a few medial SMCs migrate into the intima at the shoulder of the growing plaque, proliferate, and first give rise to fibrous cap SMCs that express ACTA2 and PDGFRB (platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta). Subsequently, cap SMCs produce progeny that migrate into the core, downregulate SMC lineage markers, and differentiate into alternative mesenchymal phenotypes that promote lesion growth ([15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B15)). Alencar et al. demonstrated that around two-thirds of SMC-derived cells express or have passed through a modulated state expressing LGALS3 (galectin 3) during their investment into the lesion. However, most cap SMCs do not pass through this intermediate stage ([21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B21)). Collectively, these findings suggest that cap SMCs originate from medial SMCs that migrate to the subendothelial space without passing through the highly modulated phenotypes characteristic of SMC-derived cells in the plaque interior.\n\nThe separation in pathways leading to cap SMCs and modulated SMC-derived cells has significant implications for anti-atherosclerotic therapies. Targeting the entire SMC population in atherosclerosis may compromise SMC investment into the fibrous cap, leading to reduced cap thickness, and increased risk of thrombotic complications ([15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B15), [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B22), [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B23)). However, strategies that target modulated SMC progeny in the lesion core could potentially represent a viable therapeutic approach, reducing plaque size without compromising fibrous cap integrity ([21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B21)). Therefore, identifying the mechanisms that determine different SMC fates in plaque and how interventions might affect the balance between plaque-stabilizing and plaque-destabilizing SMC states will be a key area for exploration in the future.\n\nIt should be noted that the mechanisms of cap formation in humans may differ from those of mice. Human lesions preferentially form in regions of the arterial tree where the arterial intima has a large pre-existing population of SMCs ([24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B24)). These intimal SMCs constitute the initial cap tissue and are the most likely sources of the fibrous cap throughout lesion development ([6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B6)). Furthermore, it remains unknown whether human cap SMCs, like murine, are the product of oligoclonal proliferation. Studies of X chromosome inactivation patterns in homogenates of micro-dissected plaques from women with heterozygous polymorphisms on X-encoded genes provided evidence that the SMC population in the cap contains large clones ([25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B25), [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B26)). However, subsequent studies found that such clones also exist in normal arteries raising the question of whether the clonal expansion occurs during artery development, physiological intimal thickening, or atherosclerosis ([26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B26), [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B27)). New approaches are needed to settle this question in upcoming years.\n\n### 2.2. Other cellular sources for cap SMCs\n\nCap SMCs in mice are primarily derived from local medial SMCs that undergo clonal expansion ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B13), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B14), [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B28)–[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B30)). However, when recruitment of medial SMCs is impaired, additional sources of cap SMCs may become quantitatively important, such as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition of surface endothelial cells ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31)). One may speculate that the existence of these alternative mechanisms would increase the resilience of the cap SMC layer to thinning, but the reality is that thin-cap fibroatheromas still form and cause clinical events ([7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B7)). This raises several questions: Do this alternative source of cap SMCs also contribute quantitatively to human fibrous caps? What are the cues necessary to initiate the transitioning process? Can it be forced to strengthen the fibrous cap and ultimately prevent plaque rupture? These are important questions for future research.\n\n### 2.3. Recapitulation of embryonic pathways in SMCs during atherosclerosis\n\nIn normal arteries, the endothelium is positioned adjacent to a supporting layer of medial SMCs, which provides mechanical stability to the wall and enables the endothelium to regulate arterial diameter for optimal blood flow. The accumulation of plaque material in the intima disrupts this symbiotic relationship. Being a layered SMC structure in the subendothelial space, it is reasonable to consider that the cap is essentially a neo-media that substitutes for the lost connection to the arterial media. This interpretation is supported by the finding that three embryonic artery developmental programs are reactivated to recruit SMCs to form the fibrous cap: NOTCH, PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), and TCF21 (transcription factor 21) signaling ([Figure 1B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#F1)).\n\nEmbryonic medial SMC differentiation relies on Notch signaling, which guides local mesenchymal precursors toward adopting SMC fate while suppressing the osteochondrogenic program ([32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B32), [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B33)). In the development of the aortic arch, the expression of JAG1 (jagged canonical Notch ligand 1) on the endothelium triggers Notch signaling in neighboring neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells, initiating the formation of a subendothelial layer of SMCs in the maturing artery. The recruited SMCs themselves express JAG1 and can thereby propagate sequential waves of SMC differentiation leading to a multilayered arterial media ([33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B33)). Notably, JAG1 and NOTCH3 (the typical Notch receptor in SMCs) are also expressed in cap cells of human and murine fibroatheromas, suggesting that Notch signaling could orchestrate cap formation through a similar mechanism ([30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B30)). This was addressed in murine atherosclerosis by blocking Notch signaling in SMCs, which effectively reduced their ability to produce ACTA2 + cap SMCs ([30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B30)). Notably, loss of Notch signaling did not affect the total recruitment or SMC-derived cells in plaques or the modulation to other SMC-derived subtypes, and gain-of-function experiments indicated that reduced Notch signaling is even required for proliferation and phenotypic modulation in murine atherosclerosis ([30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B30)). Precise regulation of the Notch signaling cascade thus appears necessary to build the cap SMC population. This involves sequential loss of Notch signaling (for SMCs to exit the media, proliferate, and accumulate in the forming plaque) followed by a gain of Notch signaling (to acquire the SMC identity in the cap), in a process that bears similarities to arterial medial development.\n\nPDGF signaling is also key for the radial construction of the developing arterial wall in murine and avian embryos ([34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B34)–[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B36)). PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor subunit B), which is secreted by nascent endothelial tubes, recruits and stimulates PDGFRB + mural cell precursors to mature into successive layers of SMCs from the inside out. As the SMCs mature, the expression of PDGFRB is downregulated, and they acquire lineage SMC markers such as ACTA2, TAGLN (transgelin), and MYH11 ([34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B34)). Notably, PDGFRB is re-expressed in early cap SMCs in murine atherosclerotic plaques ([15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B15), [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B37)). PDGF acts as a chemoattractant and mitogen for SMCs ([38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B38), [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B39)), and persistent PDGF signaling through PDGFRB is necessary for SMC investment and retention within the fibrous cap ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31), [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B40)). Mechanistically, PDGF promotes SMC migration and transitioning to an extracellular matrix-synthetic state through metabolic reprogramming, thus playing a dual role in cap formation ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31), [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B39)). Blocking PDGF signaling leads to alternative sources of cap SMCs through an endothelial-to-mesenchymal-transition mechanism driven by IL1B (interleukin 1 beta) and TGFB (transforming growth factor beta). However, these alternative sources cannot sustain fibrous cap formation and maintenance within advanced atherosclerotic lesions ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31)), highlighting the relevance of the PDGF pathway for stable cap formation.\n\nTCF21 is a transcription factor that controls cell fate decisions in the developing epicardium. TCF21 shifts epicardial progenitor cells away from the SMC lineage and is switched off in coronary vascular SMCs, but persistently expressed in epicardium-derived cardiac fibroblasts ([41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B41), [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B42)). However, upon vascular injury, TCF21 is re-expressed in vascular wall SMC precursors and promotes SMC proliferation, migration, and phenotypic modulation towards a fibroblast gene expression program ([18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B18)). TCF21 + cells are found in the fibrous cap of advanced human and murine atherosclerotic lesions ([43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B43)). TCF21 inhibits SMC differentiation by blocking the myocardin-serum response factor pathway ([44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B44)). Deletion of TCF21 in the SMC lineage reduces its ability to undergo phenotypic switching and decreases the proportion of SMC lineage cells in the fibrous cap ([18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B18)). Altogether, TCF21 expression in the adult vascular wall might be a trait of a SMC precursor cell that, in a pathological setting, shifts SMCs away from their mature, contractile function towards a more fibroblast-like phenotype and contributes to forming the fibrous cap.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/)3. Impact of therapies on the fibrous cap\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTherapies that strengthen fibrous caps have been a clear goal for researchers since plaque rupture was discovered as the main underlying cause of myocardial infarction. [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#T1) shows a non-exhaustive list of current therapies and interventions in human or murine experimental models that have been reported to affect the fibrous cap thickness or SMC content.

[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B46)) and SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibition ([47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B47)) may increase cap thickness (distance from lumen to a necrotic core). Whether this results from strengthening cap formation or less degradation is not known. Anti-inflammatory therapies, such as IL1B antagonism and colchicine, reduce the incidence of clinical events in patients with advanced atherosclerosis ([52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B52), [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B53)), but whether this is achieved partly by increasing cap thickness is also unknown. Curiously, inhibition of IL1B in murine atherosclerosis inhibited cap formation ([48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B48)). If this effect is conserved in human atherosclerosis, it could partly offset the beneficial effect of dampening macrophage-driven inflammation. Another potential modifier of fibrous cap thickness in patients is imatinib, which is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia that inhibits PDGFRB and limits cap formation in mice ([31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/#B31)).\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475556/)4. Discussion\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCells deriving from SMCs have complex roles in atherosclerosis driving plaque growth through modulation and proliferation and stabilizing the formed plaque by forming the fibrous cap. More research into the mechanisms that control the fate decisions of SMC-derived cells is needed to inform the development of therapies that can reduce plaque growth without jeopardizing the mechanical resilience of the plaque to rupture.\n\nRecent findings in animal models suggest that the fibrous cap forms by a process resembling arterial media development. First, the cap has the structure of a media, consisting of layers of SMCs with contractile protein expression that provide mechanical support for the plaque endothelium. Therefore, the fibrous cap of atherosclerotic lesions may be thought of as a neo-media, restoring the junction between the SMCs and the endothelium that is temporarily lost in early atherosclerosis due to the accumulation of lipids and inflammatory cells in the arterial intima. It should be noted, howev\n...[内容已截断]"}, {"url": "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16753-atherosclerosis-arterial-disease", "title": "What’s Clogging Your Arteries?", "summary": "Atherosclerosis is the gradual buildup of plaque (composed of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances) in arterial walls, leading to arterial hardening and narrowing. This process reduces blood flow, often remaining asymptomatic until advanced stages, when complications like heart attack or stroke occur due to plaque rupture/erosion and subsequent blood clot formation. Risk factors include high LDL cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, and aging.

In the PROSPECT trial TCFA in non-culprit areas predicted major cardiovascular events. However, a more recent study from Massachusetts General Hospital showed that TCFA led to major cardiovascular events in only 1% of patients followed for two years.\n\n![Image 1: Massachusetts General Hospital ](https://advances.massgeneral.org/assets/logos/logo-white.svg)\n\nThe definition of TCFA might partly explain these contradictory findings. Currently, fibrous cap thickness (FCT) is measured at an arbitrary point determined by visually assessing 2-D optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. That method is poorly reproducible. Also, even though two lesions may have TCFA with the same FCT, the distribution and total area of the fibrous cap may differ.\n\n[Ik-Kyung Jang, MD, PhD](https://advances.massgeneral.org/contributors/contributor.aspx?id=1006), director of the Cardiology Laboratory for Integrative Physiology and Imaging in the [Cardiology Division](http://www.massgeneral.org/cardiology)at Mass General, and colleagues are using a computer algorithm that allows 3-D volumetric analysis of fibrous caps. As they report in[_Circulation Journal_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982788),their observations have prompted them to reconsider the mechanisms of plaque rupture and which patients are at high risk of acute coronary syndromes.\n\nStudy Methodology\n-----------------\n\nThe researchers selected 23 patients with STEMI caused by plaque rupture from the Mass General OCT Registry, a data set of patients who have undergone OCT of the coronary arteries at 20 sites across six countries, and identified 27 non-culprit lesions in the culprit vessels. Non-culprit lesions were defined as plaques seen on coronary angiogram that had not been treated, with a diameter stenosis of >30% on OCT examination.\n\nAn additional 23 SA patients with 27 non-culprit plaques were matched to the STEMI patients by age and gender. With the aid of the computer algorithm, the researchers segmented FC boundaries in each frame of the OCT images. Next, the FCT at every point of the cap boundary was determined, and the FCT area per plaque was summed and classified using one of three categories: <80 μm (defined as TCFA), 80–200 μm or >200 μm.\n\nPatterns of TCFA\n----------------\n\nThe 3-D analysis showed that TCFAs were dispersed throughout the plaques, creating multiple weak areas. This pattern was especially notable in STEMI patients, who had an almost three-fold greater number of TCFAs, as well as a three-fold larger surface area in individual TCFA as compared to SA patients. Significantly, patients with STEMI had a larger area of FCT <200 μm and a smaller area of FCT >200 μm, as compared to SA patients. Moreover, the researchers showed that even in patients with STEMI, there is great variability in both the number of TCFAs as well as the size of the largest single TCFA.\n\nResearch Implications\n---------------------\n\nThe researchers suggest that plaque vulnerability may not depend on the single-point thickness of FC, as measured in current practice, but rather on the largest area of thin FC or even the sum of several TCFAs located near each other.\n\nThe data also suggest, the research team says, that changes in the whole FC pattern may be a better indicator of response to treatment and risk of future cardiovascular events than FCT measured at a single location.\n\n[view original journal article _Subscription may be required_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982788)\n\n[Circulation Journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982788)\n\nJournal Article Published: April 13, 2019\n\nLearn more about [Mass General's Division of Cardiology](https://www.massgeneral.org/cardiology/)\n\nRefer a patient to the [Mass General Heart Center](https://www.massgeneral.org/heart-center/appointments-and-referrals/)"}], "from_cache": false}}, "actual_hops": 3, "success": true, "id": 23}

This resistance arises from the production of β-lactamase enzymes, which hydrolyze the critical β-lactam ring in these antibiotics, rendering them inactive and unable to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis via penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  \n\n#### **Classification of β-Lactamases**  \nβ-lactamases are categorized by two primary systems:  \n- **Ambler Classification (Molecular)**: Based on amino acid sequence and catalytic mechanism, dividing enzymes into four classes:  \n  - **Class A**: Serine β-lactamases (e.g., TEM, SHV, CTX-M, KPC). Require a serine residue for catalysis and hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, and some carbapenems.  \n  - **Class B (Metallo-β-lactamases, MBLs)**: Depend on zinc ions (Zn²⁺) for activity (e.g., NDM, VIM, IMP). Hydrolyze most β-lactams, including carbapenems, but not monobactams like aztreonam.  \n  - **Class C (AmpC)**: Chromosomally encoded serine enzymes (e.g., P99) in Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter). Hydrolyze cephalosporins and are poorly inhibited by classical β-lactamase inhibitors.  \n  - **Class D (OXA enzymes)**: Serine β-lactamases with high activity against oxacillin (e.g., OXA-48). Some variants (e.g., OXA-17) exhibit extended-spectrum activity.  \n\n- **Bush-Jacoby-Medeiros Classification (Functional)**: Groups enzymes by substrate specificity and inhibitor susceptibility, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, and inhibitor-resistant variants.  \n\n\n#### **Mechanisms of Resistance**  \n1. **Enzymatic Hydrolysis**: β-lactamases cleave the β-lactam ring, inactivating antibiotics before they bind PBPs.  \n   - **Serine β-lactamases (Classes A, C, D)**: Use a serine residue to form a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate, which is rapidly hydrolyzed.  \n   - **Metallo-β-lactamases (Class B)**: Require Zn²⁺ ions to activate water molecules, facilitating ring cleavage.  \n\n2. **Genetic Acquisition and Spread**:  \n   - **Plasmid-Mediated Resistance**: Genes encoding β-lactamases (e.g., *blaTEM*, *blaCTX-M*, *blaNDM*) are often carried on plasmids, enabling horizontal transfer between bacteria (e.g., *E. coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*).  \n   - **Chromosomal Mutations**: Bacteria like *Enterobacter cloacae* may hyperproduce chromosomal AmpC enzymes via mutations, conferring resistance to cephalosporins.  \n\n3. **Enzyme Diversification**: Mutations in β-lactamase genes (e.g., TEM-3, SHV-2) expand substrate specificity, leading to ESBLs that hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime, cefotaxime) and monobactams (aztreonam).  \n\n\n#### **Clinical Impact and Epidemiology**  \nβ-lactamase-mediated resistance is widespread, particularly in Gram-negative pathogens:  \n- **ESBL-Producing Organisms**: Common in *E. coli* and *K. pneumoniae*, with CTX-M-15 being the most prevalent ESBL globally. These strains often exhibit multidrug resistance (MDR), including to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides.  \n- **Carbapenemases**: Enzymes like KPC, NDM, and OXA-48 hydrolyze carbapenems, leaving few treatment options (e.g., polymyxins). NDM-1, first identified in 2009, has spread globally via plasmids.  \n- **AmpC Hyperproduction**: Occurs in *Enterobacter*, *Serratia*, and *Citrobacter* species, causing resistance to cephalosporins and β-lactam/inhibitor combinations (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam).  \n\nEpidemiological studies report high prevalence rates:  \n- ESBL-producing *E. coli* causes 24.9–63% of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in regions like Lebanon and Egypt.  \n- Carbapenem-resistant *K. pneumoniae* exhibits >10% resistance in parts of Europe, with mortality rates reaching 30% for NDM-associated infections.  \n\n\n#### **Detection Methods**  \nAccurate detection of β-lactamase-mediated resistance is critical for guiding therapy:  \n- **Phenotypic Tests**:  \n  - **Combination Disk Test (CDT)**: Compares inhibition zones of cephalosporins alone vs. with clavulanic acid (≥5 mm increase indicates ESBLs).  \n  - **CarbaNP Test**: Colorimetric assay detecting carbapenem hydrolysis within 2 hours.  \n  - **Gradient Tests**: Use Etest strips with antibiotics ± inhibitors (e.g., ceftazidime/avibactam) to measure MIC reductions.  \n\n- **Genotypic Methods**:  \n  - **PCR and Sequencing**: Identify specific genes (e.g., *blaCTX-M*, *blaNDM*) and mutations.  \n  - **Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS)**: Reveals genetic context (e.g., plasmid-borne *blaKPC*) and co-resistance genes (e.g., fluoroquinolone resistance).  \n\n- **Advanced Techniques**:  \n  - **Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF)**: Rapidly identifies β-lactamase expression by detecting hydrolyzed antibiotic fragments.  \n  - **Machine Learning**: Predicts ESBL prevalence using clinical data (e.g., patient age, prior antibiotic use).  \n\n\n#### **Therapeutic Strategies**  \nTo overcome β-lactamase-mediated resistance, clinicians rely on:  \n\n1. **β-Lactam/β-Lactamase Inhibitor Combinations**:  \n   - **Classical Inhibitors**: Clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam inhibit Class A enzymes (e.g., TEM, SHV) but not Class B/C/D. Examples: amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam.  \n   - **Novel Inhibitors**: Avibactam (non-β-lactam) inhibits Class A, C, and some D enzymes (e.g., ceftazidime-avibactam). Vaborbactam (boronic acid) targets KPC carbapenemases (e.g., meropenem-vaborbactam).  \n\n2. **β-Lactamase-Stable Antibiotics**:  \n   - **Carbapenems (e.g., meropenem)**: Resistant to most Class A/C enzymes but vulnerable to MBLs and KPC.  \n   - **Cephamycins (e.g., cefoxitin)**: Resistant to ESBLs but hydrolyzed by AmpC.  \n   - **Monobactams (e.g., aztreonam)**: Stable to MBLs, often combined with avibactam for MDR infections.  \n\n3. **Alternative Agents**:  \n   - For ESBL/MBL producers: Polymyxins (colistin), tigecycline, or fosfomycin (UTIs).  \n   - For OXA-48: Temocillin (a 6α-methoxy penicillin).  \n\n4. **Pharmacodynamic Optimization**: Higher doses (e.g., prolonged-infusion meropenem) or combination therapy (e.g., aztreonam + avibactam for MBLs) may improve outcomes.  \n\n\n#### **Emerging Challenges and Resistance Evolution**  \n- **Inhibitor Resistance**: Mutations in β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-50) reduce susceptibility to clavulanate, limiting efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate.  \n- **Cross-Resistance**: ESBLs and carbapenemases often coexist with genes conferring resistance to non-β-lactams (e.g., aminoglycosides, sulfonamides).  \n- **Environmental Spread**: ESBL genes (e.g., *blaCTX-M-15*) have been detected in environmental reservoirs (e.g., rivers), linking human and animal isolates.  \n\n\n#### **Conclusion**  \nβ-lactamase-mediated resistance is a dynamic and global threat, driven by enzymatic diversity, genetic mobility, and selective pressure from antibiotic use. Combating this requires rapid diagnostics, novel inhibitors (e.g., taniborbactam), and stewardship to reduce overprescription. Understanding the molecular and epidemiological basis of resistance is critical to preserving β-lactams as first-line therapy for bacterial infections.", "page_summaries": [{"url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9688449/", "title": "Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance and opportunities for its control - PubMed", "summary": "Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance and opportunities for its control - PubMed\n\n===============\n\n Clipboard, Search History, and several other advanced features are temporarily unavailable. \n\n[Skip to main page content](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9688449/#article-details)\n\n![Image 1: U.S. flag](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/coreutils/uswds/img/favicons/favicon-57.png)\nAn official website of the United States government\n\nHere's how you know\n\n![Image 2: Dot gov](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/coreutils/uswds/img/icon-dot-gov.svg)\n\n**The .gov means it’s official.**\n\n Federal government websites often end in .gov or .mil.

Numerous beta-lactamases are known, and sequencing allows them to be divided into four Classes, A to D, with Classes A and C being the most important. Pharmaceutical chemists have responded to the spread of beta-lactamase-producing organisms by developing stable agents and inhibitors. Stability in penicillins and cephalosporins is achieved by attaching a bulky substituent to the amino group of 6-aminopenicillanic acid or 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, or by replacing the hydrogen on carbon 6 (penicillins) or 7 (cephalosporins) with an alpha-methoxy group. In carbapenems, stability is achieved by incorporation of a simple trans-6-hydroxyethyl group. Beta-lactamase-inhibitory activity occurs in many beta-lactam classes but only clavams and penicillanic acid sulphones have been developed specifically as beta-lactamase inhibitors. These inhibit most Class A and some Class D enzymes but act poorly against Class B and C enzymes. Their success is affected by the amount of enzyme, the permeability of the bacterial cell wall, the partner beta-lactam and the pH. Piperacillin/tazobactam, which combines a good inhibitor of Class A enzymes with a broad-spectrum, easily-protected penicillin, has wide activity against common pathogens, the major exceptions being strains of Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter freundii that produce large amounts of Class C enzymes, and Gram-positive cocci with modified penicillin-binding proteins. Beta-lactamase-stable beta-lactams and inhibitor combinations overcome many existing resistance mechanisms but are themselves selecting new resistances. Few new beta-lactams able to overcome these resistances are advanced in development and consequently the opportunities for control lie mostly in the more prudent use of compounds already available.\n\n[PubMed Disclaimer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/disclaimer/)\n\nSimilar articles\n----------------\n\n*   [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams alone and in the presence of beta-lactamase inhibitors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8874972/)Qadri SM, Ueno Y, Cunha BA.Qadri SM, et al.Chemotherapy. 1996 Sep-Oct;42(5):334-42. doi: 10.1159/000239464.Chemotherapy. 1996.PMID: 8874972  \n*   [[Mechanisms of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae towards beta-lactamase antibiotics].](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15700687/)Susić E.Susić E.Acta Med Croatica. 2004;58(4):307-12.Acta Med Croatica. 2004.PMID: 15700687 Croatian.  \n*   [Evolution of beta-lactamase inhibitors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7962983/)Livermore DM.Livermore DM.Intensive Care Med. 1994 Jul;20 Suppl 3:S10-3. doi: 10.1007/BF01745245.Intensive Care Med. 1994.PMID: 7962983 Review.  \n*   [Activity of 13 beta-lactam agents combined with BRL 42715 against beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria compared to combinations with clavulanic acid, tazobactam and sulbactam.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8383105/)Piddock LJ, Jin YF, Turner HL.Piddock LJ, et al.J Antimicrob Chemother. 1993 Jan;31(1):89-103. doi: 10.1093/jac/31.1.89.J Antimicrob Chemother. 1993.PMID: 8383105  \n*   [Beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase inhibitors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10526867/)Williams JD.Williams JD.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 1999 Aug;12 Suppl 1:S3-7; discussion S26-7. doi: 10.1016/s0924-8579(99)00085-0.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 1999.PMID: 10526867 Review.  \n\n[See all similar articles](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?linkname=pubmed_pubmed&from_uid=9688449)\n\nCited by\n--------\n\n*   [β-lactam resistance associated with β-lactamase production and porin alteration in clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34014957/)Khalifa SM, Abd El-Aziz AM, Hassan R, Abdelmegeed ES.Khalifa SM, et al.PLoS One. 2021 May 20;16(5):e0251594. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0251594. eCollection 2021.PLoS One. 2021.PMID: 34014957 Free PMC article.  \n*   [Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a general hospital.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16119526/)Kader AA, Kumar A.Kader AA, et al.Ann Saudi Med. 2005 May-Jun;25(3):239-42. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.2005.239.Ann Saudi Med. 2005.PMID: 16119526 Free PMC article.  \n*   [Hydrolytic mechanism of OXA-58 enzyme, a carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamase from Acinetobacter baumannii.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880707/)Verma V, Testero SA, Amini K, Wei W, Liu J, Balachandran N, Monoharan T, Stynes S, Kotra LP, Golemi-Kotra D.Verma V, et al.J Biol Chem. 2011 Oct 28;286(43):37292-303. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.280115.

Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the [antibiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic \"Antibiotic\")' structure. These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a [beta-lactam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactam \"Beta-lactam\") (β-lactam) ring. Through [hydrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis \"Hydrolysis\"), the enzyme lactamase breaks the β-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties.\n\nBeta-lactamases produced by [gram-negative bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria \"Gram-negative bacteria\") are usually secreted, especially when antibiotics are present in the environment.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid4894721-1)\n\nThe structure of a _[Streptomyces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces \"Streptomyces\")_ serine β-lactamase (SBLs) is given by [1BSG](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=1BSG). The alpha-beta fold ([InterPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPro \"InterPro\"):_[IPR012338](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR012338)_) resembles that of a [DD-transpeptidase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD-Transpeptidase \"DD-Transpeptidase\"), from which the enzyme is thought to have evolved. β-lactam antibiotics bind to DD-transpeptidases to inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Serine β-lactamases are grouped by sequence similarity into types A, C, and D.\n\nThe other type of beta-lactamase is of the metallo type (\"type B\"). Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) need metal ion(s) (1 or 2 Zn 2+ ions[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-:0-2)) on their active site for their catalytic activities.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-3) The structure of the [New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi_metallo-beta-lactamase_1 \"New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1\") is given by [6C89](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=6C89). It resembles a [RNase Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNase_Z \"RNase Z\"), from which it is thought to have evolved.\n\nMechanism of action\n-------------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta-lactamase&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Mechanism of action\")]\n\nThe two types of beta-lactamases work on the basis of the two basic mechanisms of opening the β-lactam ring.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-:0-2)\n\nThe SBLs are similar in structure and mechanistically to the β-lactam target penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which are necessary for cell wall building and modifying. SBLs and PBPs both covalently change an active site serine residue. The difference between the PBPs and SBLs is that the latter generates free enzyme and inactive antibiotic by the very quick hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe MBLs use the Zn 2+ ions to activate a binding site water molecule for the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring. Zinc chelators have recently been investigated as metallo-β-lactamase inhibitors, as they are often able to restore carbapenem susceptibility.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-4)\n\nPenicillinase is a specific type of β-lactamase, showing specificity for [penicillins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin \"Penicillin\"), again by [hydrolysing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis \"Hydrolysis\") the [β-lactam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-lactam \"Β-lactam\") ring. Molecular weights of the various penicillinases tend to cluster near 50 kilodaltons.\n\nPenicillinase was the first β-lactamase to be identified. It was first isolated by Abraham and Chain in 1940 from _E. coli_ (which are gram-negative) even before penicillin entered clinical use,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-5) but penicillinase production quickly spread to bacteria that previously did not produce it or produced it only rarely. Penicillinase-resistant beta-lactams such as [methicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin \"Methicillin\") were developed, but there is now widespread [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance \"Antibiotic resistance\") to even these.\n\nResistance in gram-negative bacteria\n------------------------------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta-lactamase&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Resistance in gram-negative bacteria\")]\n\nAmong gram-negative bacteria, the emergence of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins has been a major concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (_[E. cloacae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacter\\_cloacae \"Enterobacter cloacae\")_, _[C. freundii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrobacter\\_freundii \"Citrobacter freundii\")_, _[S. marcescens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.\\_marcescens \"S. marcescens\")_, and _[P. aeruginosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.\\_aeruginosa \"P. aeruginosa\")_) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (_[K. pneumoniae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.\\_pneumoniae \"K. pneumoniae\")_, _[Salmonella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella \"Salmonella\")_ spp., _[P. mirabilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus\\_mirabilis \"Proteus mirabilis\")_) due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs (extended spectrum beta lactamases). Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example [ceftizoxime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftizoxime \"Ceftizoxime\"), [cefotaxime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotaxime \"Cefotaxime\"), [ceftriaxone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxone \"Ceftriaxone\"), and [ceftazidime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime \"Ceftazidime\"), as well as the oxyimino-monobactam [aztreonam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztreonam \"Aztreonam\")), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins ([cephamycins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephamycins \"Cephamycins\"); in other words, [cefoxitin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefoxitin \"Cefoxitin\") and [cefotetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotetan \"Cefotetan\")); has been blocked by inhibitors such as [clavulanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavulanate \"Clavulanate\"), [sulbactam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulbactam \"Sulbactam\") or [tazobactam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazobactam \"Tazobactam\") and did not involve [carbapenems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenems \"Carbapenems\") and [temocillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temocillin \"Temocillin\"). Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins ([cephamycins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephamycins \"Cephamycins\")) such as [cefoxitin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefoxitin \"Cefoxitin\") or [cefotetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotetan \"Cefotetan\") but are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid11751104-6)\n\n### Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta-lactamase&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)\")]\n\nMembers of this family commonly express β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-3, TEM-4,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-7) and SHV-2 [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-8)) which confer resistance to expanded-spectrum (extended-spectrum) cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, this new group of enzymes, the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), was detected (first detected in 1979).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid314270-9) The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria have been gradually increasing in acute care hospitals.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-10) The prevalence in the general population varies between countries, e.g. approximately 6% in Germany[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-11) and France,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-12) 13% in Saudi Arabia,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-13) and 63% in Egypt.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-14)\n\nESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include [cefotaxime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotaxime \"Cefotaxime\"), [ceftriaxone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxone \"Ceftriaxone\"), and [ceftazidime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime \"Ceftazidime\"), as well as the oxyimino-monobactam [aztreonam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztreonam \"Aztreonam\"). Thus, ESBLs confer [multi-resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance \"Multiple drug resistance\") to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta lactams. In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. A broader set of β-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid9230382-15) The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. [Carbapenems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem \"Carbapenem\") are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant (primarily [ertapenem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ertapenem \"Ertapenem\")-resistant) isolates have recently been reported.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-Grundmann_2010-16) ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum [cephalosporins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin \"Cephalosporin\"). However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n\"Amp resistance\" redirects here. For resistance to antimicrobial peptides, see [AMP resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP_resistance \"AMP resistance\").\n\n#### TEM beta-lactamases (class A)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta-lactamase&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: TEM beta-lactamases (class A)\")]\n\nTEM-1 is the most commonly encountered beta-lactamase in [gram-negative bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria \"Gram-negative bacteria\"). Up to 90% of ampicillin resistance in [_E. coli_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli \"Escherichia coli\") is due to the production of TEM-1.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid2193616-17) Also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance that is seen in _[H. influenzae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\\_influenzae \"H. influenzae\")_ and _[N. gonorrhoeae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.\\_gonorrhoeae \"N. gonorrhoeae\")_ in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in _[E. coli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia\\_coli \"Escherichia coli\")_ and _[K. pneumoniae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.\\_pneumoniae \"K. pneumoniae\")_, they are also found in other species of gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the [extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#Extended-spectrum_beta-lactamase_(ESBL)) phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid. Single amino acid substitutions at positions 104, 164, 238, and 240 produce the ESBL phenotype, but ESBLs with the broadest spectrum usually have more than a single amino acid substitution. Based upon different combinations of changes, currently 140 TEM-type enzymes have been described. TEM-10, TEM-12, and TEM-26 are among the most common in the United States.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid14576117-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid11585791-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid15673804-20) The term TEM comes from the name of the Athenian patient (Temoniera) from which the isolate was recovered in 1963.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-21)\n\n#### SHV beta-lactamases (class A)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta-lactamase&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: SHV beta-lactamases (class A)\")]\n\nSHV-1 shares 68 percent of its amino acids with TEM-1 and has a similar overall structure. The SHV-1 beta-lactamase is most commonly found in _[K. pneumoniae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.\\_pneumoniae \"K. pneumoniae\")_ and is responsible for up to 20% of the plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance in this species. ESBLs in this family also have amino acid changes around the active site, most commonly at positions 238 or 238 and 240. More than 60 SHV varieties are known. SHV-5 and SHV-12 are among the most common.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid14576117-18) The initials stand for \"sulfhydryl reagent variable\".[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-22)\n\n#### CTX-M beta-lactamases (class A)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta-lactamase&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: CTX-M beta-lactamases (class A)\")]\n\nThese enzymes were named for their greater activity against [cefotaxime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotaxime \"Cefotaxime\") than other oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates (e.g., [ceftazidime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime \"Ceftazidime\"), [ceftriaxone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxone \"Ceftriaxone\"), or [cefepime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefepime \"Cefepime\")). Rather than arising by mutation, they represent examples of plasmid acquisition of beta-lactamase genes normally found on the chromosome of _[Kluyvera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kluyvera \"Kluyvera\")_ species, a group of rarely pathogenic commensal organisms. These enzymes are not very closely related to TEM or SHV beta-lactamases in that they show only approximately 40% identity with these two commonly isolated beta-lactamases. More than 172[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-23) CTX-M enzymes are currently known. Despite their name, a few are more active on [ceftazidime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime \"Ceftazidime\") than [cefotaxime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotaxime \"Cefotaxime\"). They are widely described among species of [Enterobacteriaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae \"Enterobacteriaceae\"), mainly _E. coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_. Detected in the 1980s they have since the early 2000s spread and are the now the predominant ESBL type in the world. They are generally clustred into five groups based on sequencing homologies; CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8, CTX-M-9 and CTX-M-25. CTX-M-15 (belonging to the CTX-M-1 cluster) is the most prevalent CTX-M-gene.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-24) An example of beta-lactamase CTX-M-15, along with IS _Ecp1_, has been found to have transposed onto the chromosome of _[Klebsiella pneumoniae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella\\_pneumoniae \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\")_ ATCC BAA-2146.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-25) The initials stand for \"Cefotaxime-Munich\".[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-26)\n\n#### OXA beta-lactamases (class D)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta-lactamase&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: OXA beta-lactamases (class D)\")]\n\nOXA beta-lactamases were long recognized as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze [oxacillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxacillin \"Oxacillin\") and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d. The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to [ampicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin \"Ampicillin\") and [cephalothin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalothin \"Cephalothin\") and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against [oxacillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxacillin \"Oxacillin\") and [cloxacillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloxacillin \"Cloxacillin\") and the fact that they are poorly inhibited by [clavulanic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavulanic_acid \"Clavulanic acid\"). Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in _[E. coli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia\\_coli \"Escherichia coli\")_, _[K. pneumoniae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.\\_pneumoniae \"K. pneumoniae\")_, and other [Enterobacteriaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae \"Enterobacteriaceae\"), the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in _[P. aeruginosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.\\_aeruginosa \"P. aeruginosa\")_. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in _[Pseudomonas aeruginosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas\\_aeruginosa \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\")_ isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.\n\nOther plasmid-mediated ESBLs, such as PER, VEB, GES, and IBC beta-lactamases, have been described but are uncommon and have been found mainly in _[P. aeruginosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.\\_aeruginosa \"P. aeruginosa\")_ and at a limited number of geographic sites. PER-1 in isolates in Turkey, France, and Italy; VEB-1 and VEB-2 in strains from Southeast Asia; and GES-1, GES-2, and IBC-2 in isolates from South Africa, France, and Greece. PER-1 is also common in multiresistant acinetobacter species in Korea and Turkey. Some of these enzymes are found in Enterobacteriaceae as well, whereas other uncommon ESBLs (such as BES-1, IBC-1, SFO-1, and TLA-1) have been found only in Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nWhile ESBL-producing organisms were previously associated with hospitals and institutional care, these organisms are now increasingly found in the community. CTX-M-15-positive [E. coli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli \"Escherichia coli\") are a cause of community-acquired [urinary infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystitis \"Cystitis\") in the UK,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-Woodford_2006-27) and tend to be resistant to all oral β-lactam antibiotics, as well as [quinolones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone_antibiotic \"Quinolone antibiotic\") and [sulfonamides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonamide_(medicine) \"Sulfonamide (medicine)\"). Treatment options may include [nitrofurantoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrofurantoin \"Nitrofurantoin\"), [fosfomycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fosfomycin \"Fosfomycin\"), [mecillinam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecillinam \"Mecillinam\") and [chloramphenicol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloramphenicol \"Chloramphenicol\"). In desperation, once-daily [ertapenem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ertapenem \"Ertapenem\") or [gentamicin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin \"Gentamicin\") injections may also be used.\n\n### Inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta-lactamase&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: Inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases\")]\n\nAlthough the inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases are not ESBLs, they are often discussed with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of _[E. coli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia\\_coli \"Escherichia coli\")_, but also some strains of _[K. pneumoniae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.\\_pneumoniae \"K. pneumoniae\")_, _[Klebsiella oxytoca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella\\_oxytoca \"Klebsiella oxytoca\")_, _[P. mirabilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus\\_mirabilis \"Proteus mirabilis\")_, and _[Citrobacter freundii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrobacter\\_freundii \"Citrobacter freundii\")_. Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by [clavulanic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavulanic_acid \"Clavulanic acid\") and [sulbactam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulbactam \"Sulbactam\"), thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam—lactamase inhibitor combinations of [amoxicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin \"Amoxicillin\")-[clavulanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavulanate \"Clavulanate\") ([co-amoxiclav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-amoxiclav \"Co-amoxiclav\")), [ticarcillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticarcillin \"Ticarcillin\")-[clavulanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavulanate \"Clavulanate\") ([co-ticarclav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-ticarclav \"Co-ticarclav\")), and [ampicillin/sulbactam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin/sulbactam \"Ampicillin/sulbactam\"), they normally remain susceptible to inhibition by [tazobactam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazobactam \"Tazobactam\") and subsequently the combination of [piperacillin/tazobactam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperacillin/tazobactam \"Piperacillin/tazobactam\"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] although resistance has been described. This is no longer a primarily European epidemiology, it is found in northern parts of America often and should be tested for with complex UTI's.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase#cite_note-pmid11585791-19)\n\n### AmpC-type β-lactamases (class C)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta-lactamase&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: AmpC-type β-lactamases (class C)\")]\n\nAmpC type β-lactamases are commonly isolated from extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

The overprescription and inappropriate use of antibiotics have accelerated the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Beta-lactamases play a critical role in mediating antibiotic resistance in UTIs. These enzymes promote bacterial resistance through multiple mechanisms, including gene mutation, plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer, and the involvement of integrons. Comprehensive knowledge of the ways in which beta-lactamases contribute to resistance in UTIs is essential for improving treatment strategies. Advances in detection technologies, such as gene sequencing and mass spectrometry, have greatly enhanced the ability to monitor and predict bacterial resistance. Current therapeutic strategies include the application of beta-lactamase inhibitors, the development of novel antibiotics, and alternative treatments that have shown efficacy against beta-lactamase-mediated antibiotic resistance.

Common symptoms include frequent urination, a burning sensation during urination, lower abdominal pain, and fever. Risk factors include gender, age, sexual activity, past history of infection, and asymptomatic bacteriuria treatment [[2](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b2-uti-2550012006)]. _Escherichia coli_ is the predominant pathogen, responsible for approximately 70%–90% of cases [[3](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b3-uti-2550012006),[4](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b4-uti-2550012006)].\n\nThe standard treatment for UTIs involves the use of antibiotics [[5](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b5-uti-2550012006)]. However, the challenge of antibiotic resistance complicates the management of these infections, often resulting in prolonged disease duration, increased complications, and treatment failure, particularly in cases of antibiotic-resistant UTIs [[6](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b6-uti-2550012006),[7](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b7-uti-2550012006)]. Beta-lactam enzymes, produced by certain bacteria, hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering them ineffective [[8](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b8-uti-2550012006)]. A significant and complex obstacle in treating UTIs is the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly those producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) [[9](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b9-uti-2550012006),[10](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b10-uti-2550012006)]. The rise of these resistant strains has considerably diminished the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics, posing substantial challenges to clinical treatment.\n\nA complete understanding of the resistance mechanisms associated with beta-lactamases, the development of effective detection methods, and the formulation of rational treatment strategies is crucial for the control and management of UTIs [[11](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b11-uti-2550012006),[12](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b12-uti-2550012006)]. This review explores the mechanisms of beta-lactamases-mediated resistance in UTIs and comprehensively summarizes and showcases advanced detection methods and treatment approaches.\n\n#### CLASSIFICATION OF BETA-LACTAMASES\n\nBeta-lactamases is an enzyme produced by drug-resistant bacteria that hydrolyzes the lactam bond in beta-lactamases antibiotics, such as penicillin and cephalosporin, leading to antibiotic resistance [[11](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b11-uti-2550012006)]. These enzymes exhibit considerable diversity and are typically classified based on their molecular biological structure or function. According to the Ambler classification, beta-lactamases are categorized into serinases (classes A, C, and D) and metalloenzymes (class B), based on the characteristics of their terminal amino acid sequences [[13](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b13-uti-2550012006)]. In the functional classification, known as the Bush classification, beta-lactamases are further divided into penicillinases, broad-spectrum enzymes, ESBLs, plasmid-mediated cephalosporinase (AmpC) and carbapenemases, based on their substrate specificities, biochemical characteristics, and susceptibility to enzyme inhibitors [[14](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b14-uti-2550012006)].\n\nNext generation sequencing, often referred to as high-throughput sequencing technology, enables the simultaneous sequencing of a large number of DNA or RNA molecules. This technology is characterized by its high throughput, rapid processing speed, and cost-effectiveness. It encompasses various methodologies, including metagenomic sequencing, whole genome sequencing, and transcriptome sequencing [[15](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b15-uti-2550012006)]. Metagenomic sequencing allows for the extraction of all microbial DNA directly from environmental samples without the need for isolation and culture, facilitating bioinformatics analyses that can identify gene sequences encoding beta-lactamases. Whole genome sequencing accurately identifies the beta-lactamases gene present in a single microbial strain by comparing it against known databases [[16](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b16-uti-2550012006)]. Additionally, transcriptome sequencing provides insights into gene expression levels and regulatory networks for all transcripts within a cell, thereby enhancing our understanding of beta-lactamases gene expression under various conditions [[17](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b17-uti-2550012006)].\n\n#### SYATUS AND MECHANISM OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE MEDIATED BY BETA-LACTAMASES\n\n 1. Status of Antibiotic Resistance Mediated by Beta-Lactamases\nA multitude of research has shown the extent of the global issue of antibiotic resistance in UTIs. A substantial body of research data indicates that the prevalence of ESBL-producing strains and multidrug resistant strains has significantly increased. This rise is associated with prolonged hospitadrug-resistantgher morbidity rates, posing considerable risks and challenges to clinical treatment. In particular. The extent of the antibiotic resistance issue was highlighted by a study that examined 876,507 positive urine culture samples from 322 hospitals in the United States between 2011 and 2020. The study found a significant increase in the proportion of strains that produce ESBL and strains that are resistant to multiple drugs [[18](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b18-uti-2550012006)]. Similar patterns were noted in other locations, such as Jiroft City, Iran, where 52.8% of _E. coli_ isolates were found to be ESBL-producing strains and the isolates from patients with UTIs were highly resistant to beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone antibiotics [[19](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b19-uti-2550012006)]. Furthermore, multidrug resistant bacteria were found in urine cultures of 226 (60.1%) adult cancer patients treated at King Hussein Cancer Center in Jordan; the majority of these strains were ESBL-producing (n=142, 62.8%) [[20](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b20-uti-2550012006)]. Globally, and particularly in Brazil, where fluoroquinolone resistance is rising annually, the number of Gram-negative infections (such _E. coli_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_) that are resistant to ESBL and carbapenem is rising. This is very dangerous [[21](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b21-uti-2550012006)]. With the majority of ESBL-_E. coli_ isolates displaying multidrug resistance, which is linked to lengthier hospital admissions and higher morbidity, the prevalence of community-acquired ESBL-_E. coli_ UTIs is also rising in the pediatric population [[22](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b22-uti-2550012006)]. According to a different study, ESBL-produced bacteria were responsible for the majority of UTIs in a Tigray referral hospital, with hospital-acquired infections being more prevalent [[23](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b23-uti-2550012006)]. The urethral symbiotic _E. coli_ of elderly residents in a Ghanaian nursing home had a high detection rate of the ESBL gene, and the majority of the isolates had multiple ESBL genes. Additionally, the high rate of resistance to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins demonstrated multidrug resistance [[24](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b24-uti-2550012006)]. The study also aimed to identify and characterize the prevalence of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance genes in _K. pneumoniae_ and _E. coli_ in patients with UTIs from western Cameroon [[9](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b9-uti-2550012006)]. The incidence of bacterial urinary tract pathogens that produce ESBLs in pregnant women in northwest Ethiopia is also concerning; findings indicate that 18.2% of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria produce ESBLs [[25](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b25-uti-2550012006)]. Antibiotic use within the previous 90 days and a history of ESBL-producing bacteria within the previous year were found to be predictors of ESBL UTIs in a study conducted by the American Medical Center in Beirut, which revealed a 24.9% prevalence of ESBL bacteria in UTIs [[26](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b26-uti-2550012006)]. Infections caused by MBL are associated with a higher 30-day mortality rate; therefore, effective antibiotic treatment should be administered as early as possible [[27](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b27-uti-2550012006)]. These studies consistently demonstrate the severity of the antibiotic resistance problem in ESBL- and MBL-producing bacteria.\n\n 2. Mechanism of Antibiotic Resistance Mediated by Beta-Lactamases\nIn UTIs, the mechanism of antibiotic resistance is a complex process that encompasses multiple levels, including various adaptive changes in the bacteria themselves and gene-level transmission [[28](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b28-uti-2550012006)]. One of the primary mechanisms of bacterial resistance is the production of beta-lactamases. This enzyme specifically targets and hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring in beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. Beta-lactamases are inactivating enzymes produced by drug-resistant bacteria, capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of lactam bonds in common beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin and cephalosporin [[29](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b29-uti-2550012006)]. Furthermore, the extensive variety of these enzymes complicates the mechanisms of bacterial resistance and exacerbates the challenges associated with combating antibiotic resistance [[30](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b30-uti-2550012006)].\n\nThe researchers did many polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on the beta-lactamases gene in patients with ESBL-positive UTIs. They found a new _CTX-M-14-like_ gene. This gene has 3 missense mutations: T55A, A273P, and R277C. These mutations made _E. coli_ more resistant to nitrofurantoin [[31](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b31-uti-2550012006)]. _CMY-192_ is a new kind of beta-lactamases. It belongs to the class A cephalosporinase family. _CMY-192_ breaks down ceftazidime, so ceftazidime cannot work well. Moreover, _CMY-192_ is resistant to avibactam. As a result, the overall antibacterial effect of ceftazidime-avibactam decreased significantly [[32](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b32-uti-2550012006)]. Integrons are capable of capturing foreign resistance genes and expressing them in bacteria, thereby facilitating the horizontal transfer of resistance and contributing to the development of multiantibiotic resistant bacteria [[33](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b33-uti-2550012006)]. As mobile genetic elements, integrons play a crucial role in the transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between bacterial populations, enhancing their resistance to antibiotics. This makes bacteria more resistant to antibiotics. This gene-transfer process is very important for spreading the genes that cause ESBL [[34](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b34-uti-2550012006)]. The _blaCTX-M-15_ gene has different effects on the resistance of _E. coli_ in chromosome or plasmid. The _blaCTX-M-15_ gene carried by the plasmid leads to increased resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics [[35](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b35-uti-2550012006)]. Beta-lactamases facilitate bacterial resistance through various mechanisms, including gene mutation, plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer, and the action of integrons ([Fig. 1A](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#f1-uti-2550012006)).\n\n[](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006)\n![Image 1: uti-2550012006f1.jpg](https://euti.org/upload//thumbnails/uti-2550012006f1.jpg)**Fig. 1.**\nBeta-lactamases play a crucial role in the regulation of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infections. (A) Beta-lactamases represents a crucial mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction detections of the beta-lactamases gene in patients with ESBL-positive urinary tract infections (UTIs) have revealed a novel _CTX-M-14_ like gene, whose mutation significantly enhances the resistance of _Escherichia coli_ to nitrofurantoin. As mobile genetic elements, integrons facilitate the transmission of antimicrobial resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer, particularly those encoding ESBL, thereby augmenting bacterial resistance. The impact of the _blaCTX-M-15_ gene on the resistance of _E. coli_ varies depending on whether the gene is located on the chromosome or the plasmid, with the plasmid carrying this gene significantly increasing resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. (B) Advanced detection technologies, including molecular biological methods, machine learning systems, and rapid detection technologies, have markedly improved the monitoring and prediction of antibiotic resistance. (C) Beta-lactamases inhibitors can obstruct the binding of beta-lactamases to small molecule beta-lactam antibiotics, thereby restoring the sensitivity of drug-resistant bacteria to these antibiotics and achieving an antibacterial effect. Alternative therapies, such as vitamin C,1,8-cineole, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have demonstrated significant potential in addressing UTIs and their associated drug resistance. ESBL, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.\n\n[Download Figure ![Image 2: Download Table](https://euti.org/image/icon_download.png)](https://euti.org/journal/Figure.php?xn=uti-2550012006.xml&article_dir=&id=f1-uti-2550012006&mode=export)\n\n#### DETECTION TECHNIQUE OF BETA-LACTAMASES\n\n 1. New Detection Tool for Beta-Lactamases\nA thorough understanding of the resistance mechanism of beta-lactamases and the development of efficient detection methods are essential for the control and treatment of UTIs. Developing new tools to detect potential targets can improve treatment and slow down the growth of antibiotic resistance. Machine learn-based methods such as Classification and Regression Trees and Random Forest can effectively predict ESBL bacteria and their multidrug resistance. Furthermore, these techniques can identify key characteristics closely related to the development of ESBL, including patient age and antibiotic usage [[36](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b36-uti-2550012006)]. By creating a particular substrate cephalosporin-conjugated sensitizer that releases biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid sensitized to terbium luminescence in the presence of beta-lactamases, a paper-based photoluminescence test for terbium ions has been established to quickly and precisely identify drug-resistant bacteria [[37](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b37-uti-2550012006)]. Furthermore, mass spectrometry is quicker than conventional culture techniques and can rapidly detect the expression of beta-lactam enzymes [[38](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b38-uti-2550012006)]. Using computational biology techniques, 7 possible drug targets against multidrug resistant uropathogenic _Escherichia coli_ strains that produce ESBL were found. In addition, the subcellular localization of 2 targets ECNA114_0085 and ECNA114_1060, cytoplasmic and periplasmic respectively, was predicted by computer simulation. These targets can be used to design drugs against ESBL-producing multidrug resistant uropathogenic _E. coli_ [[39](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b39-uti-2550012006)]. A brief review of previous ESBL-positive urine culture results can help clinicians more precisely choose empirical antibiotic therapy and increase treatment success rates. These results are also very useful in clinical practice for predicting the pathogen identity of future UTIs [[40](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b40-uti-2550012006)].The CRISPR-Cas systems target and cleave DNA or RNA through base pairing guided by crRNA[[41](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b41-uti-2550012006)]. In the presence of the target, the bypass activity is activated to degrade the probe, thereby achieving high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of pathogenic bacteria [[42](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b42-uti-2550012006)]. Researchers made a detection system. It combines PCR and CRISPR-LbCas12a technology. This system can quickly and accurately detect _Klebsiella_ and its ESBL-positive strains, making it appropriate for medical facilities without PCR equipment [[43](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b43-uti-2550012006)]. The efficacy of 2 novel culture systems—InTray COLOREX Screen/ESBL and Compact Dry—in identifying pathogens and ESBL-positive bacteria in urine samples was evaluated. These systems demonstrated not only exceptional sensitivity and specificity but were also cost-effective and user-friendly [[44](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b44-uti-2550012006)]. Using advanced detection technologies, we can better monitor antibiotic resistance. This helps clinicians choose the right antibiotics for treatment.\n\n 2. Gene Sequencing Technology for Beta-Lactamases\nGene sequencing technology can provide detailed gene sequence information and identify specific beta-lactamases genotypes. Gene sequencing technology plays an important role in understanding the diversity and resistance mechanism of beta-lactamases [[45](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b45-uti-2550012006)]. Gene sequencing can show the distribution of drug resistance genes in various geographical areas. For instance, community-acquired urinary tract pathogenic _E. coli_ in Nouna primarily carry the _blactX-M-1,3,15_ genes, indicating that _CefoTaXime-Munich_ ESBLs are relevant in local UTIs [[46](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b46-uti-2550012006)]. Research conducted in North India has revealed increased ESBL-positive rates for _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _E. coli_, with the most prevalent ESBL types being _CTX-M-1, CTX-M-15, TEM_, and _SHV_ [[47](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b47-uti-2550012006)]. A study in New Zealand found a genetic link between ESBL-producing _E. coli_ from human clinical samples and those from the environment. It shows that rivers might be a source of ESBL-_E. coli_. The study especially noted the distribution of the ST131 sequence type and the _bla(CTX-M-15)_ gene [[48](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b48-uti-2550012006)].\n\nFurthermore, multidrug resistant bacteria and their resistance mechanisms were discovered using genome sequencing. For instance, a Provencencia strain that simultaneously produces _bla(NDM-1), bla(VIEM-1)_, and _bla(OXA-10)_ was first identified. Because this strain carries multiple beta-lactamases genes, it may be challenging to choose an antibiotic for clinical treatment [[49](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b49-uti-2550012006)]. Two strains of Providence were found to have several resistance genes, particularly the carbapenase gene and several beta-lactamases genes, according to whole genome sequencing [[50](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b50-uti-2550012006)].\n\nWhole genome sequencing was employed to analyze ESBL-producing uropathogenic _E. coli_ ST127 strain isolates obtained from patients across 5 hospitals in Armenia. Notably, these uropathogenic _E. coli_ ST127 strain were found to produce ESBLs and carry genes encoding these enzymes, including _bla(CTX-M-3), bla(CTX-M-236)_, and _bla(TEM-1)_ [[51](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b51-uti-2550012006)]. Through a characteristic analysis of the plasmid carrying the blaNDM-1 gene extracted from _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, it was found that a metallic beta-lactamase known as NDM-1 can hydrolyze carbapenem antibiotics, rendering bacteria resistant to these potent drugs. In addition to the _bla(NDM-1)_ gene, the IncX3 plasmid also harbors other resistance genes, including _ble(MBL)_ and _aph(3')-VI_, indicating that the plasmid confers multidrug resistance [[52](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b52-uti-2550012006)]. Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases genes, including _blaCTX-M, blaSHV_, and _blaTEM_, have been widely detected in multidrug resistant urinary tract pathogens [[53](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b53-uti-2550012006)]. _E. coli_ strains that produce AmpC beta-lactamases are prevalent in UTIs and exhibit high levels of drug resistance. The common genes associated with this resistance include _bla(CIT), bla(EBC), bla(FOX)_, and _bla(DHA)_ [[54](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b54-uti-2550012006)].\n\nThe coexistence of _NDM-1_ and _OXA-10_ beta-lactamases genes in carbapenem-resistant Citrobacter DY2019 was also revealed for the first time by whole genome sequencing, suggesting that the strain spreads several resistance genes via various plasmids [[55](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b55-uti-2550012006)]. Multiple PCR identified the _TEM, SHV_, and _CTX-M_ genes encoding broad-spectrum beta-lactamases in _P. aeruginosa_ and _K. pneumoniae_ isolated from individuals with UTIs, indicating the presence of multidrug resistance [[56](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b56-uti-2550012006)]. _K. pneumoniae_ exhibits genotypic and phenotypic resistance incompatibility. Notably, some isolates harboring the _blaKPC, blaIMP, blaVIM_, or _blaNDM-1_ genes demonstrate phenotypic sensitivity to imipenem [[57](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b57-uti-2550012006)] ([Fig. 1B](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#f1-uti-2550012006)).\n\n#### THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES OF BETA-LACTAMASE IN URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS\n\n 1. Beta-Lactam/Beta-Lactamases Inhibitor Combinations\nBeta-lactamases inhibitors such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam are widely used in clinical practice. These beta-lactam inhibitors significantly enhance the antibacterial activity of beta-lactam antibiotics by inhibiting most class A beta-lactam enzymes except carbapenase. However, they have limited inhibitory ability on class B, C, and D enzymes. In pediatric febrile UTIs, the study supported using methicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, or cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanate together for treatment [[58](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b58-uti-2550012006)]. Cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid significantly increased cefixime's antibacterial activity against _E. coli_ that produced ESBL, indicating that cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid could be a beneficial oral regimen for treating UTIs brought on by ESBL-positive _E. coli_ [[59](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b59-uti-2550012006)]. By preventing the breakdown of beta-lactam antibiotics, piperacillin/tazobactam restored the antibacterial effect of ESBL, highlighting the significance of beta-lactam inhibitors in managing bacteria that produce ESBL [[60](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b60-uti-2550012006)]. In treating complex UTIs, ceftolozane/tazobactam has a highly effective antibacterial effect against multidrug resistant strains [[61](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b61-uti-2550012006)]. Novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamases inhibitor combinations, like ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and imipenem-sulbactam, exhibited high activity and similar coverage against contemporary _P. aeruginosa_ isolates. It is an important treatment option to combat the infection [[62](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b62-uti-2550012006)]. In addition, ETX1317 is a novel broad-spectrum beta-lactamases inhibitor. It binds to the beta-lactam active site and prevents it from hydrolyzing beta-lactam antibiotics. Compared with existing inhibitors like avibactam, it has stronger inhibition ability, a broader inhibition spectrum, and potential clinical application prospects [[63](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b63-uti-2550012006)]. In summary, beta-lactamases inhibitors are important in treating infections caused by multidrug resistant strains, especially against ESBL-producing bacteria and _P. aeruginosa_. These inhibitors restore and enhance the antimicrobial activity of beta-lactam antibiotics and reduce the development of resistance.\n\nAvibactam and sulbactam are inhibitors of diazabicyclooctane enzymes. They do not have a beta-lactamases structure and are not easily hydrolyzed. They have a broader spectrum of beta-lactamases inhibition, and the inhibition effect is reversible. By creating a persistent covalent intermediate with class A beta-lactamases, particularly the CTX-M type, avibactam offers a novel solution to the issue of beta-lactamases-mediated resistance. This effectively inhibits enzyme activity by preventing the deacetylation route [[64](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b64-uti-2550012006)]. Avibactam is a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that neutralizes ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases, restoring the efficacy of amicanam against drug-resistant pathogens. Azithromycin-avibactam is a new combination therapy against multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, particularly strains that produce MBLs [[65](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b65-uti-2550012006)]. Phase III clinical trial results confirm that imipenem-cilastatin-sulbactam is effective and safe for treating complex UTIs and intraperitoneal infections. The drug's approval provides a new tool to combat multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens [[66](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b66-uti-2550012006)]. Avibactam and relebactam are non–beta-lactam beta-lactamases inhibitors. In treating multidrug resistant strains, they have significant antibacterial activity and exemplary safety. These inhibitors can restore the antibacterial effect of beta-lactam antibiotics and provide a new and effective method for clinical treatment.\n\nDue to their simultaneous inhibition of serine beta-lactamases and MBLs, polycyclic borates, including bicyclic borates, exhibit promising therapeutic application prospects. The broad-spectrum inhibitory potential of developed bicyclic borates, like taniborbactam, to effectively inhibit class C beta-lactam enzymes, like AmpC, was discovered through enzyme kinetics and crystallographic studies. Nevertheless, the potent AmpC inhibition of these inhibitors is independent of their acyl-amino side chains [[67](https://euti.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14777/uti.2550012006#b67-uti-2550012006)]. Polycyclic borate beta-lactamases inhibitors have unique structures and inhibition mechanisms, which can provide a new therapy for overcoming antibiotic resistance. \n...[内容已截断]"}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2", "title": "Escape mutations circumvent a tradeoff between resistance to a beta-lactam and resistance to a beta-lactamase inhibitor", "summary": "Introduction\n------------\n\nResistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, mediated primarily through beta-lactamases, is growing as a major threat to public health. Beta-lactams are commonly used for the treatment of a range of bacterial pathogens, constituting the most widely prescribed antibiotic class[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR1 \"Van Boeckel, T. P. et al. Global antibiotic consumption 2000 to 2010: an analysis of national pharmaceutical sales data. Lancet Infect.

Nat. Med. 25, 1143–1152 (2019).\"). These antibiotics are characterized by a core of a beta-lactam ring and are classified by their moieties into four major families: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR3 \"Page, M. I. The mechanisms of reactions of.beta.-lactam antibiotics. Acc. Chem. Res. 17, 144–151 (1984).\"). The irreversible binding of these drugs to the peptidoglycan cross-linking enzymes (Penicillin Binding Proteins, PBPs) leads to cell death and lysis. Resistance to beta-lactams has become widespread in recent years, mainly through drug degradation by beta-lactamases, most notably by the serine beta-lactamases of classes A and C[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR4 \"Babic, M., Hujer, A.

Opin. Pharmacol. 18, 56–60 (2014).\"). Hydrolyzing the core beta-lactam ring, these enzymes decrease the effective drug concentration, thereby conferring increased resistance[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR6 \"Ambler, R.

The effectiveness of these enzymes is often further improved either by mutations that increase their expression or by intragenic structural mutations that enhance their efficacy and specificity[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR9 \"French, G.

To overcome beta-lactamase mediated antibiotic resistance, beta-lactam antibiotic treatments are often supplemented by a beta-lactamase inhibitor[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR15 \"Todd, P.

Rev. 23, 160–201 (2010).\"). These inhibitors compete with the drug for the same binding site, yet being resilient to degradation they block enzyme activity thereby restoring antibiotic efficacy. While class A beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanate or tazobactam, are commonly used, efficient inhibitors of the widespread class C beta-lactamases have only recently been introduced.\n\nClass C beta-lactamases confer resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, penicillins, and monobactams[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR18 \"Jacoby, G.

Like other beta-lactamases, they are highly transferable and widespread among Gram-negative bacteria, especially in clinical isolates[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR20 \"Nadjar, D. et al.

E. et al. Avibactam is a covalent, reversible, non–β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 109, 11663–11668 (2012).\"). Avibactam can substantially decrease the resistance level of class C beta-lactamase-carrying bacteria to beta-lactam drugs[30](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR30 \"Wang, X. et al.

Agents Chemother. 58, 1774–1778 (2014).\"). Indeed, avibactam was recently approved for clinical use in combination with the cephalosporin ceftazidime and a combination of avibactam with the monobactam aztreonam is currently in clinical trials[31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR31 \"Zhanel, G.

It is therefore important to understand the potential for evolutionary adaptation of the enzyme to combinations of avibactam with different beta-lactams.\n\nResistance to beta-lactamase inhibitors is typically associated with increased susceptibility to beta-lactam drugs, representing inherent constraints on adaptive mutations. While mutations that increase beta-lactamase expression can increase resistance to the drug alone and in combination with the inhibitor, resistance to the drug-inhibitor treatment via structural intragenic mutations is inherently constrained: due to the structural similarity between the drug and the inhibitor, mutations that increase drug degradation also tend to increase the affinity of the enzyme to the inhibitor[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR7 \"Philippon, A., Labia, R. & Jacoby, G.

Less is known though about mutations that escape this tradeoff, allowing the mutant to survive, even in the presence of the inhibitor, at drug concentrations that kill the wild-type in the absence of the inhibitor (native inhibitory concentration). In particular, it is unclear how prevalent are such escape mutations, how specific they are to different beta-lactams and whether they might be accessible via a single amino-acid substitution.\n\nHere, focusing on _E. coli_ Bla ampC enzyme as a model for class C beta-lactamases, we constructed a systematic single amino-acid substitution mutant library and identified resistance and escape mutations to avibactam paired with different beta-lactam drugs. Measuring growth of the mutants across gradients of different drugs, with and without avibactam, we found that escape mutations are accessible but only for some drugs and not others. These escape mutations allow bacteria to grow even at the presence of avibactam at the high drug concentrations required to kill the wild-type without avibactam. Sequencing the selected mutant library, we identified these escape mutations and found that they are rare and drug-specific.\n\nResults\n-------\n\n### Deep mutant library of _bla_ _ampC_\n\nTo systematically study the tradeoffs between mutations that confer resistance to beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitors, we constructed a library of mutants inside the beta-lactamase encoding gene, _bla_ _ampC_. First, we identified in silico 44 residues at and in the near vicinity of the active pocket of the Bla ampC enzyme (Methods; Supplementary Fig.[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#MOESM1)). Next, starting with an _E. coli_ parental strain expressing the chromosomal _bla_ _ampC_, we systematically mutated these intragenic positions using Multiplexed Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE, Fig.[1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#Fig1); Methods)[43](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#ref-CR43 \"Wang, H.

Our design guaranteed that each mutated codon differed from the wild-type codon by 2–3 nucleotides, thereby much reducing misidentifications caused by sequencing errors (Methods, Supplementary Data[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#MOESM4); this 2-mutation constraint still allows access to the vast majority of possible amino-acid changes: 846 out of the potential 44 ×(19 amino acids + stop) = 880 single substitution mutants, 96%). The mutant library contained 93.4% of these designed single amino-acid substitutions, with mutant frequencies distributed with an average and standard deviation of 5.3 × 10−5 ± 4.2 × 10−5 (as identified by amplicon sequencing using Illumina’s MiSeq, Methods, Supplementary Fig.[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#MOESM1)).\n\n**Fig. 1: Identification of escape mutations by site-directed mutagenesis followed by selection and sequencing.**\n\n[![Image 1: figure 1](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-020-15666-2/MediaObjects/41467_2020_15666_Fig1_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2/figures/1)\n\n**a** The _bla_ _ampC_ gene of _E. coli_ is mutated using MAGE technology to yield a mutant library of 790 different single amino-acid substitutions in the Bla ampC pocket. **b** The mutant library is then selected on a gradient of beta-lactam antibiotics with or without avibactam (AVI) and cell density is measured (Gray shade). At the antibiotic concentration that inhibits the growth of the WT bacteria (\\(MIC_{AB}^{\\rm{W}T}\\), white cells), only resistant mutants grow and a decline in cell density is observed (light gray).

Each drug was applied with or without the beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam (AVI). Culture density was monitored over time for the mutant library as well as the parental strain (WT, expressing unmutated _bla_ _ampC_). As drug concentration increased, the cultures took longer to reach detectable OD, yet grew at similar rates (Fig.[2a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#Fig2)). To characterize these time delays we measured _t_ _th_, the time in which culture density crossed a set threshold, _OD_ _th_. Next, for each drug concentration, we represented the measured delay by an estimated initial density of resistant mutants \\(OD_{{\\mathrm{Res}}}^0 = {\\mathrm{OD}}_{{\\mathrm{th}}} \\cdot e^{ - g \\cdot t_{{\\mathrm{th}}}}\\), where _g_ is bacterial growth rate (Fig.[2a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#Fig2); Supplementary Fig.[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#MOESM1)). Plotting \\({\\mathrm{OD}}_{{\\mathrm{Res}}}^0\\) against drug concentration, we defined the critical drug concentration _η_ at which the expected initial density of the mutants drops below an OD value corresponding to the expected number of cells of a typical MAGE mutant (\\(OD_{{\\mathrm{Res}}}^0(\\eta ) = {\\mathrm{OD}}_{{\\mathrm{single}}\\;{\\mathrm{mutant}}}\\), where \\({\\mathrm{OD}}_{{\\mathrm{single}}\\,{\\mathrm{mutant}}}\\)=3.3 × 10−8, Methods). For each of the tested antibiotics (AB), we interpolated this critical drug concentration needed to prevent the growth of all initially present mutants for both the wild-type (\\(\\eta _{{\\mathrm{AB}}}^{{\\mathrm{WT}}}\\)) and the MAGE library (\\(\\eta _{{\\mathrm{AB}}}^{{\\mathrm{MAGE}}}\\), Fig.[2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#Fig2)). We also subjected these same cultures to gradients of the same drugs in the presence of 0.25 μg/ml avibactam and determined the corresponding critical drug concentrations (\\(\\eta _{{\\mathrm{AB}}}^{{\\mathrm{WT}}}|^{{\\mathrm{AVI}}}\\), \\(\\eta _{{\\mathrm{AB}}}^{{\\mathrm{MAGE}}}|^{{\\mathrm{AVI}}}\\), Fig.[2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#Fig2)).\n\n**Fig. 2: Combined with avibactam, different drugs differ substantially in the potential for escape mutations.**\n\n[![Image 2: figure 2](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-020-15666-2/MediaObjects/41467_2020_15666_Fig2_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2/figures/2)\n\n**a** Growth of the MAGE mutant library on a gradient of PIP concentrations plotted as Optical Density (_OD_) as a function of time.

The drug concentration \\(\\eta\\) beyond which the value of \\({\\mathrm{OD}}_{{\\mathrm{Res}}}^0\\) drops below a density corresponding to a single initial mutant is determined (triangles on the bottom axis). The shift in the concentration required to inhibit the mutant library in the presence of AVI, compared to that required for the WT in the absence of AVI, is indicated by a purple arrow. A left-pointing arrow indicates that at the presence of AVI, no single mutant could grow at the drug-only MIC, while a right-pointing arrow is an indication for escape mutants. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2/figures/2)\n\nWild-type Bla ampC mediated resistance varied substantially for different drugs, as well as its potential for resistance improving mutations. Supplementing cultures with avibactam lowered the resistance of the wild-type to piperacillin, aztreonam, cefepime and ampicillin (Fig.[2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#Fig2)), but not to meropenem (Supplementary Fig.[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#MOESM1)) indicating that active Bla ampC confers differential resistance to these drugs. Considering the phenotypes of the wild-type _bla_ _ampC_ and the MAGE mutant library without avibactam, we found that while no intragenic mutations in _bla_ _ampC_ led to increased ampicillin resistance, resistance to the other three drugs vastly improved (Fig.[2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#Fig2), triangles). We next asked whether these mutations that increase resistance to piperacillin, aztreonam and cefepime in the absence of avibactam can possibly also escape the drug-inhibitor tradeoff.\n\nContrasting the drug concentration required to inhibit the mutant library in the presence of avibactam with the native inhibitory concentration, we find that escape mutations are accessible for some drugs and are not accessible in others. While no escape mutants are observed for piperacillin (\\(\\eta _{{\\mathrm{PIP}}}^{{\\mathrm{MAGE}}}|^{{\\mathrm{AVI}}} < \\eta _{{\\mathrm{PIP}}}^{{\\mathrm{WT}}}\\), left-pointing arrow, Fig.[2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#Fig2)), escape mutations do appear for aztreonam and cefepime (\\(\\eta _{{\\mathrm{ATM}}}^{{\\mathrm{MAGE}}}|^{{\\mathrm{AVI}}} > \\eta _{{\\mathrm{ATM}}}^{{\\mathrm{WT}}}\\) and \\(\\eta _{{\\mathrm{FEP}}}^{{\\mathrm{MAGE}}}|^{{\\mathrm{AVI}}} > \\eta _{{\\mathrm{FEP}}}^{{\\mathrm{WT}}}\\), right-pointing arrow). To identify the genetic determinants of such escape mutations, we next analyzed the specific mutations leading to resistance to beta-lactam drugs and to drug-inhibitor combinations.\n\n### Drug-resistant mutants identified by amplicon sequencing\n\nTo identify resistance-conferring mutations, we applied amplicon deep sequencing to a mutant library selected on gradients of beta-lactam drugs. First, to allow Illumina sequencing of the entire MAGE library, we pooled the 44-residue MAGE mutant libraries into two pools based on their position in the primary sequence. Second, we enriched these two pools for resistant mutants by selection on gradients of beta-lactam drugs with and without avibactam, then pooling cultures that grew on high drug concentrations to establish “enriched mutant libraries”. Finally, we subjected duplicates of these two enriched mutant libraries on gradients of different beta-lactams with and without avibactam, recorded OD and chose a comprehensive subset of cultures for amplicon sequencing (Supplementary Fig.[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#MOESM1); Illumina MiSeq, Methods). Analyzing the amplicon reads, we identified, for each condition, the abundance of the WT and each of the mutants (Methods). Then, to estimate the resistance level of each mutant to each of the drugs (\\(IC50_{{\\mathrm{AB}}}^{{\\mathrm{Mut}}}\\)), we fitted the measured abundance data of each of the mutants across all drug concentrations with a dose-response model and determined the drug concentration that inhibits the mutant growth by 50% (Fig.[3a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#Fig3), Methods; Supplementary Fig.[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#MOESM1); Supplementary Data[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2#MOESM5)).\n\n**Fig. 3: Mutations that confer resistance to one drug are often sensitizing to other drugs.**\n\n[![Image 3: figure 3](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-020-15666-2/MediaObjects/41467_2020_15666_Fig3_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15666-2/figures/3)\n\n**a** For each of the 122 identified mutants we calculated resistance to FEP, AZT, and PIP as the drug concentration that inhibits mutant growth, \\({\\mathrm{IC}}50_{{\\mathrm{AB}}}^{{\\mathrm{Mut}}}\\), divided by that of the WT \\({\\mathrm{IC}}50_{{\\mathrm{AB}}}^{{\\mathrm{WT}}}\\).

Beta-lactam antibiotics are divided into 5 basic classes as penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, carbapenems and beta-lactamase inhibitors according to the beta-lactam ring side chains and other rings. All beta-lactam antibiotics affect by inhibiting the enzymes (penicillin binding proteins, PBPs) involved in the cross-linking of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, which is depotentiated, and this leads to osmotic rupture. Beta-lactam antibiotics are one of the most common antibacterial agents used in the treatment of both community and hospital-acquired infections. Due to the widespread use of beta-lactam antibiotics, it is observed that bacteria also develop new resistance mechanisms and their resistance to these antibiotics is increasing. Beta- lactamases are the main responsible for resistance to these antibiotics and the failure of beta-lactam antibiotics in treatment. Therefore, beta-lactamase inhibitors have been developed and combined with beta-lactam antibiotics.\n\nThese inhibitors are not effective all types of beta-lactamases. In addition, the discovered beta-lactamases are increasing day by day. Characterization of the beta-lactamase type is essential for the detection of the effective antibiotherapy. In this review, the classification of beta-lactamases, the methods used in laboratory detection of beta-lactamases and the current beta-lactamase inhibitors used in treatment will be discussed.\n\n##### Keywords\n\n• Beta-lactamase; ESBL; Antibiotic resistance;\n\n Carbapenamases\n\n##### Citation\n\nU?rakl?

The beta-lactams ring was the common structure in the developed penicillin derivatives. The beta-lactam nucleus, 6-APA proved to be the key in penicillin synthesis and modification.Penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, carbapenems are located in the beta-lactam antibiotic group [2].\n\nBeta-lactam antibiotics, whose mechanism of action is inhibition of the last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis, are the largest family of antimicrobial agents and the most widely used in current clinical practice. Unfortunately, increasing resistance to these antibiotics limits their utility [3]. Mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams contain the production of efflux pumps, the modification or reduced production of outer membrane porins (in Gram negative bacteria), alterations of Penicillin\u0002Binding Proteins (the molecular target of beta-lactams) and the production of beta-lactamase (an enzyme able to break down beta-lactam ring) [4]. One of the primary mechanisms of bacterial resistance to beta-lactams is through the production of beta lactamase enzymes [3].\n\nBeta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLICs), such as piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate, are particularly useful for the treatment of infections caused by organisms that produce beta-lactamases [5,6].\n\n##### BETA-LACTAMASES\n\nThe beta-lactamases breaks the beta-lactam ring and makes the antibiotic inactive before it reaches the PBP targetInitially beta-lactamases were intended by the name of the strain or plasmid that produced them, an example that persists in such enzyme names as PC1 or P99. In 1975, the application of isoelectric focusing for beta-lactamase characterization allowed many more enzymes to be differentiated [7-9].\n\nThe characterization and classification of beta lactamases were facilitated by the use of DNA sequencing. While plasmid mediated enzymes are generally expressed in Gramnegativeorganisms basicly, chromosomally located inducible expression of beta-lactamases is also extensive [10,11].\n\nBeta-lactamases are evaluated by two basic classifications [12]. The molecular classification proposed by Ambler (in 1980 suggests four distinct molecular classes: A, B, C and D based on the amino acid sequencing and the conserved motifs [13]. Although classes A, C and D enzymes utilize serine for beta-actam hydrolysis, class B metalloenzymes that require divalent zinc ions (metal ion) for substrate hydrolysis [10].\n\nThe second scheme is named as Bush, Jacoby, and Medeiros functional classification, which groups different beta-lactamases according to their substrate and inhibitor profiles, was first attempted in 1989 and then improved in1995. This method correlates the beta-lactamases with phenotypes in clinical isolates [13]. Based on the differences among the enzymes in these groups, they were further divided into several subgroups [14]. The three major groups of enzymes are described by their substrate and inhibitor profiles: group 1 cephalosporinases that are not well inhibited by clavulanic acid; group 2 penicillinases, cephalosporinases and broad spectrum beta-lactamases that are generally inhibited by active site-directed beta-lactamase inhibitors; and the group 3 metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) that hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems and that are poorly inhibited by almost all beta-lactamcontaining molecules [14,15].\n\n**Group 1 Cephalosporinase**\n\nGroup 1 enzymes are cephalosporinases belonging to molecular class C. AmpC enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. Transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for AmpC enzymes, hence transferable between species. These enzymes appeared in Enterobacteriaceae that lack chromosomal AmpC enzymes (Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp. and Klebsiella spp) or only express low basal level of AmpC like Escherichia coli and Shigella spp [16].\n\nAmpC beta-lactamases are active on penicillins but even more active on cephalosporins and can hydrolyze cephamycins such as cefoxitin and cefotetan; oxyiminocephalosporins such as ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone. They are usually resistant to inhibition by clavulanic acid [15]. They have a high affinity for aztreonam, in contrast to the class A cephalosporinases [17].\n\nAmpC beta-lactamases encoded by chromosomal are expressed principally at very low grades.These enzymes generally do not paytake to beta-lactam resistance, but in some organisms (Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii and especially Enterobacter cloacae) they can be provaked under certain situations such as the existence of a beta-lactam [as amoxicillin, ampicillin, imipenem, and clavulanic acid ]. The indicuble enzymes cause clinical resistance and failure of treatment [18].\n\n**Group 2 Serine Beta-Lactamases**\n\nFunctional group 2 beta-lactamases, containing molecular classes A and D, represent the largest group of beta-lactamases, due primarily to the increasing identification of ESBLs [19].\n\n**Subgroup 2a:**These beta-lactamases represent penicillinase activity. They are the predominant beta-lactamases in Grampositive cocci. Subgroup 2a beta-lactamases are inhibited by clavulanic acid and tazobactam. These beta-lactamases have insufficient activtiy on cefalosporins.\n\n**Subgroup 2b:**Comprises enzymes that hydrolyze penicilin and early cefalosporin such as cephaloridine and cephalothin, and are strongly inhibited by clavulanic acid and tazobactam. The subgroup 2b contain the TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 enzymes [19].\n\n**Subgroup 2be:** Include enzymes that are capable of inactivating third-generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefpodoxime) as well as monobactams (aztreonam). Because of their board activity against third generation cefalosporins they are named Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Organisms that produce ESBLs proceed an important reason for therapy failure with cephalosporins and have serious consequences for infection control [20]. Most ESBLs can be divided into three groups: TEM, SHV, and CTX-M types [21].\n\n**TEM types ESBLs:** TEM-3, originally reported in 1989, was the first TEM-type beta-lactamase that displayed the ESBL phenotype. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, they are also found in other species of Gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency [22].\n\n**SHV type ESBLs:**Substitutions found in SHV-type derivatives are shown under the amino acids of SHV-1[22].\n\n•**CTX-M type ESBLs:**Because of its predominant cefotaxime activity and the location of its isolation (Munich) was named CTX-M. These enzymes are not very closely related to TEM or SHV beta-lactamases in that they share only approximately 40% identity ith these two commonly isolated beta-lactamases [23]. CTX-M type ESBLs possess extraordinary high hydrolytic activity against cefotaxime than ceftazidime [24]. In addition to the rapid hydrolysis of cefotaxime, another genuine characteristic of these enzymes is that they are inhibited better by the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam than by sulbactam and clavulanat [25].\n\n•**Subgroup 2br:**Broad-spectrum beta-lactamases that have acquired resistance to clavulanic acid\n\n•**Subgroup 2ber:** Contains TEM enzymes that combine an extended spectrum with relative resistance to clavulanic acid inhibition. These group includesTEM-50, which had amino acid substitutions common to both the ESBL and inhibitor-resistant TEMs, was recently identified. This enzyme was resistant to inhibition by clavulanate, but it also conferred a slight resistance to the expanded spectrum cephalosporins [26].\n\n**Subgroup 2c:**These beta-lactamases are able to hydrolyze carbenicillin or ticarcillin at least % 60 as rapidly as benzylpenicillin. These penicillinases are generally easily inhibited by clavulanic acid or tazobactam [15].\n\n•**Subgroup 2ce:**Includes the recently named extended spectrum carbenicillinase RTG-4 (CARB-10) with expanded activity against cefepime and cefpirome [27].\n\n•**Subgroup 2d:**beta-lactamases distinguished by their ability to hydrolyze cloxacillin or oxacillin and thereby are known as OXA enzymes. Many beta-lactamases in this subgroup are inhibited by NaCl.\n\n•**Subgroup 2de:** Are cloxacillin or oxacillin hydrolyzing enzymes with an extended spectrum that includes oxyimino-beta-lactams but not carbapenems. OXA-11, OXA-14 and OXA-15 beta-lactamases are in this group. They have most often been found in Turkey and France.\n\n•**Subgroup 2df:**2df beta-lactamases are OXA enzymes with carbapenem-hydrolyzing activities. The OXA type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin.They are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin and the fact that they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. In Acinetobacter baumannii, OXA type beta-lactamases are usually produced by genes that are located on the chromosome [28]. However, OXA-23 and OXA-48, which have been identified in Enterobacteriaceae, are aquired by genes on plasmids [29].\n\n•**Subgroub 2e:** Characteristics of the subgroup 2e cephalosporinases include the ability to hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins and to be inhibited by clavulanic acid or tazobactam. They can be confused with the group 1 AmpC enzymes or with ESBLs because they may appear in similar organisms and with comparable resistance profiles. Subgroup 2e enzymes can be differentiated from AmpC enzymes by their poor affinity for aztreonam [30].\n\n**Subgroup 2f:** Include serine carbapenemases from ambler class A. Carbapenemases are beta-lactamases that have the activity of hydrolyzing carbapenems. They have the ability to hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams and carbapenems. This group enzymes can be inhibited better by tazobactam than by clavulanic acid.\n\nThe beta-lactamases in which molecular classes A and D have a serine-based hydrolytic mechanism, whereas molecular class B beta-lactamases are all metalloenzymes with an active-site zinc.\n\nThe class A serine carbapenemases contain the NMC (for “not metalloenzyme carbapenemase” ), IMI (imipenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase”), SME (for “Serratia marcescens enzyme”), GES (Guiana-Extended-Spectrum) and KPC (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase) . Of these, SME, NMC and IMI are chromosomally encoded enzymes [31].\n\nKPC and GES are plasmid-encoded group 2f enzymes. The first KPC-producing K pneumoniae isolate was reported in 2001 [32]. Although KPCs are associated with K. pneumoniae, this enzyme has also been identified in other several gram negative bacteria [33]. KPCs are encoded by the blaKPC gene that interprets transitions between species. Global spring is largely explained by its location in the Tn3-type transposon, Tn4401 [34]. KPCs may appear to be susceptible to imipenem and meropenem in automated routine susceptibility testing, leading to misdiagnosis and making it difficult to diagnose.\n\nKPC carbapenemases have been associated with outbreaks due to multidrug resistant Gram negative bacterial infection, especially in US **[35].**\n\n**Subgroup 3**\n\nThis group include MBLs which is is also classified in Ambler class B. MBLs are a group of featured enzymes that can inactivate most commonly used beta-lactambased antibiotics including carbapenem. They are separated from the other serine carbapenemases by their requirement for zinc ion to be used in their active site. The MBLs have insufficient affinity or hydrolytic capability for monobactams and are not inhibited by clavulanic acid or tazobactam. The MBLs are inhibited by metal ion chelators such as EDTA and dipicolinic acid.The first metallo\u0002beta-lactamases identified and studied were Bacillus cereus, Aeromonas spp. and S. maltophilia, which are chromosomal enzymes found in opportunistic pathogenic bacteria [36]. The most common metallo-beta-lactamase families include the enzymes VIM, IMP, GIM and SIM which are included in the various integron constructs in which they are included as gene cassettes. These integrons can be easily transferred between bacteria by plasmids or transposons [37]. Rapidly spreading antibiotic resistance is a major problem both clinically and epidemiologically. The importance of metallo-beta-lactamases in the rapid spreadof resistance has recently increased. The newly identified New Delhi MBL 1 (NDM-1) is a novel member of this family that is capable of hydrolysing a broad variety of clinically important antibiotics [38].\n\nThe first bacterial isolate carrying the MBL later designated blaNDM-1 was a Klebsiella pneumoniae from a Swedish patient of Indian origin who traveled to New Delhi and acquired a urinary tract infection there [39,40]\n\nThe bla-NDM-1 gene was found on a resistance conferring genetic element that was easily passed on to other Enterobacteriaceae and that implicated a variety of other resistance regions such as containing a gene encoding CMY 4 (a broad-spectrum beta-lactamase) and genes inactivating ciprofloxacin, erythromycin rifampicin, and chloramphenicol. NDM-1 can hydrolyze all beta-lactams except aztreonam. Bacterial infections producing NDM-1 are difficult to treat. There are many antibiotic resistances except polymyxins [39,41].\n\n**Subgroup 4**\n\nThis group contains enzymes that have as yet been incompletely characterized.\n\n##### DETECTION OF BETA-LACTAMASE-MEDIATED RESISTANCE\n\n**Recommended methods for detection of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae**\n\nIt is recommended ormandatory to determine the ESBL to take infection precautions in many places.The recommended method for detecting ESBL-producing Enterobactericae is based on non-susceptibility to indicator oxyimino-cephalosporins, followed the application of phenotypic tests. Broth dilution, agar dilution, disk diffusion or an automated system can be used for ESBL-screening in Enterobacteriaceae. It is needed that both cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone) and ceftazidime are used as indicator cephalosporins.\n\n**Phenotypic confirmation methods**\n\nThe common phenotypic methods are the combination disk test (CDT), the double-disk synergy test (DDST), the ESBL gradient test, and the broth microdilution test that based on the in vitro inhibition ofESBL activity by clavulanic acid are recommended for ESBL confirmation [20,42].\n\n**Combination disk test (CDT):**The basis of this method is to evaluate the inhibition zone around a disk of cephalosporin and around a disk of the same cephalosporin plus clavulanate. The test is positive if the inhibition zone diameter is ≥5 mm larger with clavulanic acid than without [43].\n\n**Double-disk synergy test (DDST):**Disks containing cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime; each of them 30 µg) are applied to medium either side of one containing clavulanic acid (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid;containing 10 µg of clavulanate) positioned at a distance of 20 mm (centre to centre). A positive result is indicated when the inhibition zones around any of the cephalosporin disks are augmented or there is a ‘keyhole’ in the direction of the disk containing clavulanic acid [20].\n\n**Gradient test method:**ESBL gradient tests have been developed in order to quantify the synergy between extended spectrum cephalosporins and clavulanate. The test is positive if ≥ eightfold (more than three doubling dilution steps) reduction is evaluated in the MIC of the cephalosporin combined with clavulanic acid compared with the MIC of the cephalosporin alone or if a phantom zone or deformed ellipse is present [43]. Interpreting results of the ESBL gradient test strips is delicate and requires training. In addition, ESBL detection by gradient test may fail when the MIC values for cephalosporins fall outside the range ofMICs available on the test strip [40].\n\n**Broth microdilution:**Mueller-Hinton broth containing serial twofold dilutions of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, or cefepime with or without clavulanic acid was prepared. An eightfold or greater decrease in the MIC of any of the cephalosporins in the presence of clavulanic acid was considered a positive result for ESBL.\n\nIndeterminate test results and false-negative test results may result from the overproduction of AmpC beta-lactamases, which mask the occurrence of ESBLs. Phenotypic confirmatory tests based on the detection of cephamycin hydrolysis or AmpC inhibition will distinguish AmpC beta-lactamases from ESBLs. Cefepime (used as indicator cefalosporin) is generally not hydrolyzed by AmpC beta-lactamases. Cefepime may be used in all the CDT, DDST, gradient test or broth dilution test formats. Alternative approach contain use of cloxacillin, which is a good inhibitor of AmpC enzymes [44].\n\n**Genotypic confirmation:**Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be time consuming and exhaustive due to the wide variety of mutations in ESBL-encoding genes. A microarray approach would be of great help in detecting simultaneously several enzyme-encoding genes from a single strain [44].\n\n**Recommended methods for detection of carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae**\n\nMeropenem is the carbapenem which provides the best balance of sensitivity and specificity and thus it is usually preferred in routine susceptibility tests. According to EUCAST methodology [46]; Ertapenem screening cut-off for zone diameter < 25mm (with 10 µg disks) and MIC >0,125mg/L, meropenem screening cut-off for zone diameter < 28mm (with 10 µg disks) and MIC >0,125mg/L. Isolates of reduced sensitivity to carbapenems in routine susceptibility testing; phenotypic methods should be applied to detect carbapenemases.\n\n**Combination disk testing:**The requirements for the combination disc test method are commercially available from many manufacturers. The disks include meropenem ± several inhibitors. Class A carbapenemases are inhibited by boronic acid. Class B carbapenemases (MBLs) are inhibited by dipicolinic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). There are no appropriate inhibitors for OXA-48-like enzymes. OXA-48-like carbapenemase producers exhibit high resistance( >128 mg/L, zone diameter) to temocillin, but this is not specific enough to be a phenotypic marker The main disadvantage of CDT is that it takes a long time (overnight incubation) [45].\n\n**Biochemical (colorimetric) tests:**The CarbaNP test will give rise to a pH-change resulting in a colour shift from red to yellow with phenol red solution. The test uses isolated bacterial colonies and is based on in vitro hydrolysis of a carbapenem, imipenem. The advantages of the test are that it is rapid (<2hours) and cheaper than molecular methods [46].\n\n**Carbapenem inactivation method:**The basis of this method is to determine enzymatic hydrolysis by incubating a carbapenem with a bacterial suspension.The main disadvantages of this technique that the negative predictive value of the test is still not clear and it takes a long time.\n\n**Detection of carbapenem hydrolysis with MALDI-TOF**\n\nWith the use of molecular methods in the field of microbiology, there have been many advances in this area. As one of the important products of these advances that ’matrix-assisted laser desorbtion / ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been used in recent years to examine microbiological materials [47]. The basis is to determine in a mass spectrometry appliance (MALDI TOF) the decrease or disappearance of definite specific peaks of carbapenems in a mass spectra when a bacterial suspension is in advance incubated with the carbapenem. The method has been demostrated in various studies to have good sensitivity and specificity [48].The disavantage of this tecnique that optimization and standardization of the MALDI-TOF MS assay are required for each drug–enzyme combination separately. Furthermore, it requires expert knowledge for evaluation because the mass spectrum of each antibiotic is different [49].\n\n**Current overview of carbapenemases**\n\nThe globalemerge of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has become a major threat to public health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recently classified CPE as one of the most urgent antimicrobial-resistance threats. The transmission of CPE occur by plasmids, or transposons from person to person, with such transmission existing predominantly in healthcare institutions. Since KPC was identified in 1996 in the United States, it has emerge rapidly other countries including Italy, Colombia and the United Kingdom. At present, OXA-48 is the most prevalent and is widespread in Klebsiella pneumoniae in Turkey, the Middle-East, North Africa and Europe. On account their point mutant analogues with ESBLs, OXA-48–type producers are among the most difficult carbapenemase producers to be characterised. Therefore, their true prevalence rates are difficult to estimate [50].\n\nSince NDM was first reported in India [41], the sequences of 18 NDM variants (NDM-19 unpublished) have been reported. Treatment of bacterial infections with the spread of NDM producing bacteria around the world is becoming increasingly difficult with antibiotics being ineffective. Unfortunately, very few reseach on NDM variants focus on animal-derived bacterial isolates. NDM-17 was discovered in an E. coli strain isolated from a chicken [51]. Recently, a novel NDM variant, NDM-20, was described in anEscherichia coli strain isolated from a swine [52].\n\n**The current situation in global antibiotic resistance**\n\nThe European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) has published its 2017 report with the participation of data from 30 European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries. EARS-Net data for 2017 show that antimicrobial resistance remains a serious threat in Europe. For invasive bacterial infections, prompt treatment with effective antimicrobial agents is especially important and is one of the single most effective interventions to reduce the risk of fatal outcome. For Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, combined resistance to various antimicrobial groups was frequent, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was extensive. Resistance percentages were mostly higher in K. pneumoniae than in E. coli. While carbapenem resistance remained rare in E. coli, several countries reported carbapenem resistance percentages above 10% for K. Pneumoniae (Figure 1.1). Carbapenem resistance was also common in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species, and at higher percentages compared with K. Pneumonia [53].\n\n##### DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nAntibiotic resistance has reached levels that threaten the whole world. If emergency measures are not put into practice, an increase in infection-related deaths is possible. In order to prevent the spread of resistance and control of infections, countries need to establish urgent action plans and a global surveillance system is needed. In order to reduce the propagation of resistance genes, we should also take steps to control the resistance in animal food-borne reservoirs.\n\n##### REFERENCES\n\n1.[Fleming A.

It affects approximately 60% of the population at some point in life, with most cases being minor and manageable at home. However, severe or recurrent epistaxis may require medical intervention. Epistaxis is classified into two primary types based on the bleeding site: anterior and posterior.  \n\n\n### **Types and Pathophysiology**  \n- **Anterior Epistaxis**: The most common type (90% of cases), originating from the anterior nasal septum, specifically Kiesselbach’s plexus—a highly vascular network of capillaries and small vessels supplied by the anterior ethmoidal, sphenopalatine, greater palatine, and superior labial arteries. The fragile mucosa in this region is easily irritated or damaged, leading to bleeding.  \n- **Posterior Epistaxis**: Less common but more severe, arising from larger vessels in the posterior nasal cavity (e.g., Woodruff’s plexus, supplied by the sphenopalatine artery). Bleeding may flow down the throat, causing swallowing or coughing of blood, and poses higher risks of airway compromise or aspiration.  \n\n\n### **Etiology**  \nEpistaxis arises from diverse causes, categorized as local, systemic, environmental, or medication-induced:  \n\n#### **Local Causes**  \n- Trauma: Digital manipulation (nose-picking), blunt injury (e.g., facial trauma), foreign body insertion (common in children), or nasal surgery (e.g., septoplasty).  \n- Structural abnormalities: Deviated septum, nasal polyps, or tumors (rare, but associated with unilateral bleeding and other symptoms like obstruction or pain).  \n- Inflammation: Allergic or nonallergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or chronic nasal cannula use (drying mucosa).  \n\n#### **Systemic Causes**  \n- Coagulopathies: Hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, immune thrombocytopenia, or leukemia.  \n- Vascular conditions: Hypertension, atherosclerosis, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).  \n- Other: Alcoholism (impairs platelet function), pregnancy (increased vascularity), or liver disease (clotting factor deficiencies).  \n\n#### **Environmental Factors**  \n- Dry air (low humidity in heated spaces, high altitudes, or winter months) leading to mucosal drying and cracking.  \n- Irritants: Chemical fumes, smoking, or recreational drugs (e.g., cocaine insufflation).  \n\n#### **Medications**  \n- Anticoagulants: Warfarin, heparin, aspirin, NSAIDs, or clopidogrel.  \n- Nasal sprays: Overuse of decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline) or corticosteroids (drying effect).  \n- Supplements: High-dose vitamin E, ginkgo, or ginseng (antiplatelet effects).  \n\n\n### **Risk Factors and Epidemiology**  \n- **Age**: Peaks in children (2–10 years, due to nose-picking and mucosal fragility) and older adults (50–80 years, associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and mucosal atrophy).  \n- **Gender**: Slightly more common in males.  \n- **Comorbidities**: Hypertension, bleeding disorders, or chronic nasal conditions.  \n\n\n### **Clinical Presentation**  \n- **Symptoms**: Bleeding from one or both nostrils; posterior bleeds may present with blood in the throat, nausea, or vomiting (from swallowed blood). Severe cases can cause dizziness, syncope, or hypotension (rare).  \n- **History**: Key details include duration, frequency, inciting events (e.g., trauma, dry air), medications (anticoagulants, nasal sprays), and family history of bleeding disorders.  \n- **Physical Examination**: Visualization with a nasal speculum, headlamp, and suction to identify the bleeding source. Anterior bleeds are often visible; posterior bleeds may require endoscopy.  \n\n\n### **Diagnosis**  \nDiagnosis is primarily clinical, based on history and direct observation. Additional tests may include:  \n- **Blood tests**: CBC (anemia), INR/PT (anticoagulant monitoring), or coagulation studies (e.g., von Willebrand factor) for recurrent or severe cases.  \n- **Imaging**: CT scan or nasal endoscopy to evaluate structural abnormalities (e.g., tumors, polyps) in recurrent or unexplained bleeding.  \n\n\n### **Management and Treatment**  \n#### **First-Line (At-Home) Interventions**  \n- **Direct Pressure**: Sit upright, lean forward, and pinch the soft nasal alae (below the nasal bridge) for 10–20 minutes to compress Kiesselbach’s plexus. Avoid tilting the head back (risk of aspiration or gastric irritation).  \n- **Vasoconstrictors**: Topical oxymetazoline (Afrin) or phenylephrine sprays to reduce bleeding.  \n- **Humidification**: Saline nasal sprays or gels (e.g., Vaseline) to moisten dry mucosa.  \n\n#### **Medical Interventions**  \n- **Cauterization**: Silver nitrate (chemical) or electrocautery to seal bleeding vessels; used for visible anterior bleeds. Avoid bilateral cautery to prevent septal perforation.  \n- **Nasal Packing**: Anterior packing (e.g., Merocel tampons, Rapid Rhino balloons) for persistent anterior bleeds; posterior packing (e.g., Foley catheter, long nasal tampons) for posterior bleeds. Packing remains in place for 24–48 hours and may require prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., cephalexin) to prevent toxic shock syndrome.  \n- **Medication Adjustment**: Temporary discontinuation or reversal of anticoagulants (e.g., vitamin K for warfarin, protamine for heparin) in severe cases.  \n- **Tranexamic Acid**: Topical or oral antifibrinolytic agent to promote clot stability.  \n\n#### **Advanced Treatments**  \n- **Embolization**: Interventional radiology to occlude feeding vessels (e.g., sphenopalatine artery) for refractory posterior bleeds.  \n- **Surgical Ligation**: Ligation of the sphenopalatine, ethmoidal, or external carotid arteries for severe, recurrent bleeding.  \n- **Septoplasty**: Correction of deviated septum to reduce mucosal irritation.  \n\n\n### **Complications**  \n- **Anterior Bleeds**: Rare complications, but may include anemia (with recurrent bleeding).  \n- **Posterior Bleeds**: Airway compromise, aspiration, hypovolemic shock, or pressure necrosis (from packing). Nasal packing may also cause sinusitis, septal hematoma, or toxic shock syndrome (rare).  \n\n\n### **Prevention**  \n- **Humidify air**: Use humidifiers in dry environments.  \n- **Nasal care**: Saline sprays, petroleum jelly, or nasal gels to prevent mucosal drying. Avoid forceful nose-blowing or picking.  \n- **Allergy management**: Control rhinitis with antihistamines or corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.  \n- **Risk reduction**: Quit smoking, limit alcohol, and wear protective headgear during contact sports.  \n- **Medication review**: Adjust anticoagulants or nasal sprays under medical supervision.  \n\n\n### **When to Seek Emergency Care**  \nEmergency evaluation is required for:  \n- Bleeding >20 minutes despite pressure.  \n- Large blood loss (>1 cup) or signs of hypovolemia (dizziness, pallor, tachycardia).  \n- Posterior bleeding (blood in throat, bilateral nostril bleeding).  \n- Concurrent trauma (e.g., head injury), difficulty breathing, or vomiting blood.  \n- Patients on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders.  \n\n\nEpistaxis is typically benign, but prompt recognition of severe or recurrent cases ensures appropriate management and prevents complications. Interprofessional collaboration (primary care, ENT, hematology, radiology) optimizes outcomes for complex cases.", "page_summaries": [{"url": "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/13464-nosebleed-epistaxis", "title": "Nosebleeds (Epistaxis): Causes, Treatment & Prevention", "summary": "Nosebleeds (Epistaxis): Causes, Treatment & Prevention\n\n===============\n\n![Image 3](https://ca264331a46e4359af48029ef070df94.svc.dynamics.com/t/v/89JF2Fa-exV-5ixaiTVui1y_gqYcnxAVAB0ZZvIj8rs/laIDW4L6vglCUIesyPRiORvlHZVjdZr4td90lJuE/Vah35-ST?ad=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F13464-nosebleed-epistaxis&rf=&id=2441859130)\n\nLocations:\n\n[Abu Dhabi](https://www.clevelandclinicabudhabi.ae/en)|[Canada](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/canada)|[Florida](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/florida)|[London](https://clevelandcliniclondon.uk/)|[Nevada](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/locations/nevada)|[Ohio](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/)|\n\n![Image 4: Gray gradient](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/_next/static/media/gray-gradient-left-16.59910877.svg?w=32&q=75)![Image 5: Gray gradient](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/_next/static/media/gray-gradient-right-32.dd7ce4e5.svg?w=64&q=75)\n\n[800.223.2273](tel:8002232273)|[MyChart](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/online-services/mychart)|[Need Help?](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/help)|[Careers](https://jobs.clevelandclinic.org/)|[Donate Now](https://give.ccf.org/give/187824#!/donation/checkout)|\n\n![Image 6: Gray gradient](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/_next/static/media/gray-gradient-left-16.59910877.svg?w=32&q=75)![Image 7: Gray gradient](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/_next/static/media/gray-gradient-right-32.dd7ce4e5.svg?w=64&q=75)\n\n[![Image 8: Cleveland Clinic logo](https://assets.clevelandclinic.org/transform/1bc1ff31-3cbc-4976-9ddf-9bc85e0877eb/Cleveland-Clinic-Logo-Web?w=3840&q=75)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/)\n\n[Find a Provider](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/providers)[Locations and Directions](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/locations)[Institutes and Departments](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments)[Patients and Visitors](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/patients)[Health Library](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health)\n\n*   [Find a Provider](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/providers)\n*   [Locations and Directions](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/locations)\n*   [Institutes and Departments](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments)\n*   [Patients and Visitors](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/patients)\n*   [Health Library](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health)\n\n[![Image 9: Search](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/_next/static/media/LondonGreenSearchIcon.6d7e718f.svg?w=64&q=75)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/search)Menu\n\n[![Image 10: Search](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/_next/static/media/LondonGreenSearchIcon.6d7e718f.svg?w=64&q=75)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/search)[Request an Appointment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/webappointment/what-to-expect)\n\n[Home](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/)/\n\n[Health Library](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health)/\n\n[Diseases & Conditions](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases)/\n\nNosebleed (Epistaxis)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNosebleed (Epistaxis)\n=====================\n\nEpistaxis, or a nosebleed, is when you lose blood from the tissue that lines the inside of your nose.

A nosebleed — meaning a loss of [blood](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24836-blood) from the tissue that lines the inside of your [nose](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21778-nose) — can occur in one or both nostrils. Usually, it only affects one nostril.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services.[Policy](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/advertising)\n\nYour nose has many tiny [blood vessels](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21640-blood-vessels) in it. These vessels help warm and moisten the air you breathe. But they lie close to the inner surface of your nose. When air moves through your nose, it can dry and irritate your blood vessels. This makes them very easy to injure or break, causing a nosebleed.\n\nAbout [6 in 10 people](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33704939/) will have at least one nosebleed at some point in life. Most nosebleeds are minor and go away with at-home care. But if bleeding is severe or you have other symptoms (like vomiting or trouble breathing), you should go to the emergency room.\n\n#### Types of nosebleeds\n\nThere are two main types of nosebleeds. Healthcare providers describe them by the site of the bleeding.\n\n##### Anterior nosebleed\n\nAn anterior nosebleed starts in the front of your nose on the lower part of the wall that separates the two sides of your nose (septum). [Capillaries](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21988-capillaries) and small blood vessels in this front area of your nose are fragile and can easily break and bleed. This is the most common type of epistaxis and usually isn’t serious. You can usually treat these nosebleeds at home.\n\n##### Posterior nosebleed\n\nA posterior nosebleed occurs deep inside your nose. A bleed in larger blood vessels in the back part of your nose near your throat causes this type. It can result in heavy bleeding, which may flow down the back of your throat. You may need medical attention right away for this type of nosebleed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSymptoms and Causes\n-------------------\n\n![Image 11: Nosebleeds have many causes, including dry air, allergies and recreational drug use](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/-/scassets/images/org/health/articles/13464-nosebleed)\n\nA nosebleed, or epistaxis, is the loss of blood from the tissue that lines the inside of your nose.\n\n### What are the symptoms of a nosebleed?\n\nUsually, you won’t have any symptoms other than blood coming from your nose. If you have a posterior nosebleed, some blood may drain down the back of your throat into your stomach. This can cause a bad taste in the back of your throat and make you feel nauseated.\n\nIf you have additional symptoms, it may be a sign of a medical condition.\n\n### What causes a nosebleed in one nostril?\n\nMost nosebleeds only affect one nostril, but they can affect both at the same time. Epistaxis has many causes. Fortunately, most aren’t serious.\n\nThe most common cause of nosebleeds is dry air. The air is typically drier in:\n\n*   Hot, low-humidity climates\n*   Areas at high altitudes\n*   Heated indoor spaces\n\nDry air causes your [nasal membrane](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23930-mucosa) (the delicate tissue inside your nose) to dry out and become crusty or cracked. It’s then more likely to bleed when rubbed or picked or when blowing your nose.\n\nYou may also develop a nosebleed if you:\n\n*   Insert an object in your nose\n*   Injure your nose and/or face\n*   Have a [deviated septum](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16924-deviated-septum)\n*   Have an [upper respiratory infection](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4022-upper-respiratory-infection) or [sinus infection](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17701-sinusitis) that makes you keep sneezing, coughing and blowing your nose\n*   Have [allergic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever) or [nonallergic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17950-nonallergic-rhinitis) rhinitis (inflammation of your nasal lining)\n*   Frequently use [antihistamine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21223-antihistamines) or [decongestant](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/24923-nasal-decongestant) nasal sprays, which can dry out your nasal membranes\n*   Take blood-thinning medications like aspirin, [NSAIDs](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/11086-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-medicines-nsaids) or warfarin\n*   Breathe in chemicals from cleaning supplies, fumes at your workplace or other strong odors\n*   Use recreational drugs (like cocaine) that you inhale through your nose\n\nLess common causes of nosebleeds include:\n\n*   Alcohol use\n*   Bleeding disorders, like [hemophilia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14083-hemophilia) or [von Willebrand disease](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17709-von-willebrand-disease)\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Atherosclerosis\n*   Facial and nasal surgery\n*   [Nasal tumors](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24927-nasal-tumors)\n*   [Nasal polyps](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15250-nasal-polyps)\n*   [Immune thrombocytopenia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14430-thrombocytopenia)\n*   [Leukemia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4365-leukemia)\n*   [Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15618-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia-hht)\n*   Pregnancy\n\n#### What causes nosebleeds while sleeping?\n\nThe reasons for [nosebleeds during sleep](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-causes-nosebleeds-while-sleeping/) are the same as the reasons why they occur during the day. Dry air, allergies and upper respiratory infections damage the delicate nasal membrane lining your nose. Sleeping with your head to the side may also put direct pressure on your nasal cavity and cause epistaxis at night.\n\n### Risk factors\n\nAnyone can get nosebleeds. Most people will have at least one case in their lifetimes. But some people are more likely to have a nosebleed. They include:\n\n*   **Children between the ages of 2 and 10**. Dry air, colds, [allergies](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8610-allergies) and sticking fingers and objects into their noses make children more prone to nosebleeds.\n*   **Adults between the ages of 45 and 80**.Blood may take longer to clot as you approach the age of 50. Around this age, you’re also more likely to have [high blood pressure](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4314-hypertension-high-blood-pressure), [atherosclerosis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16753-atherosclerosis-arterial-disease) (hardening of the walls of arteries) or a [bleeding disorder](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21545-blood-disorders).\n*   **Those who are pregnant**.Blood vessels in your nose expand while you’re [pregnant](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9709-pregnancy-am-i-pregnant), which puts more pressure on the delicate blood vessels in the lining of your nose.\n*   **People taking blood-thinning medications**. These drugs include aspirin and [warfarin](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/16182-warfarin-a-blood-thinning-drug-what-you-need-to-know-).\n*   **People who have blood clotting disorders**. These include hemophilia and von Willebrand disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiagnosis and Tests\n-------------------\n\n### When should I worry about a nosebleed?\n\nAlthough seeing blood coming out of your nose can be alarming, most nosebleeds aren’t serious. You can usually manage them at home. But you should [call a healthcare provider](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/do-you-get-too-many-nosebleeds-when-to-worry) if:\n\n*   You get nosebleeds often\n*   You have symptoms of [anemia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3929-anemia) (feeling weak, faint, tired, cold or short of breath or having pale skin)\n*   You get a nosebleed around the time you start a new medication\n*   You get nosebleeds and also notice unusual bruising all over your body — this combination may indicate a more serious condition such as a blood-clotting disorder (hemophilia or von Willebrand disease), leukemia or a nasal tumor\n\nCall your pediatrician if your child is under age 2 and has a nosebleed. No matter your child’s age, it’s a good idea to mention any nosebleeds at their next [well-check](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/when-does-my-child-need-shots-and-well-checks).\n\n### How doctors diagnose this condition\n\nA healthcare provider asks you questions about your nosebleed, including:\n\n*   Length (in minutes) of your nosebleed\n*   Approximate amount of blood that came out\n*   How often you get them\n*   If the bleed involved one or both nostrils\n\nThey also ask about:\n\n*   Medications, including over-the-counter (OTC) [blood-thinning medications](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22288-anticoagulants) like aspirin and drugs for colds and allergies\n*   Your biological family history, including any history of blood disorders\n*   Your use of alcohol and/or any recreational drugs in which you sniffed the drug up your nose\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext, your provider examines your nose to determine the source of the bleeding and what may have caused it. They use a small speculum to hold your nostril open and use various light sources or an [endoscope](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22156-nasal-endoscopy) (lighted scope) to see inside your nasal passages.\n\nYour provider may use topical medications to numb (anesthetize) the lining of your nose and to narrow blood vessels. Your provider may remove clots and crusts from inside your nose. This can be unpleasant but isn’t painful.\n\nOccasionally, they may order [X-rays](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/21818-x-ray), a [CT scan](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4808-computed-tomography-ct-scan) or [blood tests](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24508-blood-tests) to check for bleeding disorders, blood vessel abnormalities or nasal tumors.\n\nManagement and Treatment\n------------------------\n\n### What are the treatments for epistaxis?\n\nNosebleed treatment depends on the cause of the bleeding. Your provider will explain what’s necessary in your situation. Epistaxis treatment may include:\n\n*   **Nasal packing**. Your healthcare provider inserts gauze, special nasal sponges or foam, or an inflatable latex balloon into your nose to create pressure at the site of the bleed. Your provider may want to leave the material in place for 24 to 48 hours before removing it.\n*   **Cauterization**. This procedure involves applying a chemical substance (silver nitrate) or heat energy ([electrocautery](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24032-electrocauterization)) to seal the bleeding blood vessel. Your provider sprays a local anesthetic in your nostril first to numb the inside of your nose.\n*   **Medication adjustments/new prescriptions**. Reducing the amount of blood-thinning medications you take — or stopping them — can be helpful. In addition, medications for managing blood pressure may be necessary. Your provider may prescribe [tranexamic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20792-tranexamic-acid-oral-tablets) (Lysteda®), a medication to help blood clot.\n*   **Foreign body removal**. If the cause of the nosebleed is a foreign object, your provider will remove it.\n*   **Surgery**.Surgery can repair a broken nose or correct a deviated septum ([septoplasty](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17779-septoplasty)).\n*   **Ligation**. In this procedure, your provider ties off the culprit blood vessel to stop the bleeding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### How can I stop a nosebleed at home?\n\nFollow [these steps](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-stop-a-nosebleed) to stop a nosebleed:\n\n*   Keep calm and breathe through your mouth.\n*   Sit up straight with your head slightly forward.\n*   Use your thumb and index finger to pinch the soft sides of your nose (just above your nostrils).\n*   Wait for the bleeding to stop. Use a tissue or damp washcloth to catch the blood.\n\nAt-home care is often enough. But some nosebleeds need medical care at a hospital.**Have someone drive you to the nearest emergency room or call 911 (or your local emergency service number) if:**\n\n*   You can’t stop the bleeding after more than 15 to 20 minutes of pinching your nose\n*   The blood loss is large (more than 1 cup)\n*   You’re taking blood-thinning medications (like aspirin or warfarin) or have a blood-clotting disorder and the bleeding won’t stop\n*   You’re having difficulty breathing\n*   You’ve swallowed blood and can’t stop vomiting\n*   Your nosebleed happened after a blow to your head or a serious injury (fall, car accident or a smash to your face or nose)\n\n### Can I drink water after a nosebleed?\n\nYes, you should drink plenty of fluids after a nosebleed. Good options include water, juice and other non-caffeinated liquids. After you experience epistaxis, some blood may drain down the back of your throat into your stomach. This may make you feel nauseated. But drinking water won’t affect a nosebleed.\n\n#### Can you die from a nosebleed?\n\nNosebleeds that occur higher on your septum or deeper in your nose may be harder to control. However, nosebleeds are rarely fatal.\n\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\n\n[Find a Primary Care Provider](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/primary-care)\n\n[Schedule an Appointment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/primary-care#call-to-action-panel)\n\nPrevention\n----------\n\n### What can I do to prevent nosebleeds?\n\nHere are some tips for preventing nosebleeds:\n\n*   Use a [saline nasal spray](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/saline-solution) or saline nose drops two to three times a day in each nostril to keep your nasal passages moist. You can purchase these products over the counter or you can make them at home.\n*   Add a humidifier to your furnace or run a humidifier in your bedroom at night to [add moisture to the air](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-best-combat-effects-dry-winter-air/).\n*   Spread a nasal gel or ointment in your nostrils with a cotton swab. Bacitracin®, Vaseline® or Ayr Gel® are examples of over-the-counter ointments you can use. Be sure not to insert the swab more than 1/4 inch into your nose. You can purchase these gels and ointments in most pharmacies.\n*   Avoid blowing your nose too forcefully.\n*   Sneeze [through an open mouth](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/dont-stifle-that-sneeze-you-could-get-hurt). Always sneeze into a tissue or your elbow.\n*   Avoid putting anything solid into your nose, including your fingers.\n*   Limit your use of medications that can increase bleeding, like aspirin and ibuprofen. Always check with your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medications. This is especially important for prescribed medications like warfarin (Coumadin®) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n*   See your provider if you can’t easily control your nasal allergy symptoms with over-the-counter or prescription medications. Make sure you closely follow the directions when using over-the-counter products. Overusing them can cause nosebleeds.\n*   [Quit smoking](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/quitting-smoking/). Smoking dries out your nose and irritates it.\n*   Wear protective headgear if you do activities that could result in an injury to your face and nose.\n\nTo help your child avoid nosebleeds, teach them not to put things up their nose. It’s also a good idea to keep your child’s fingernails short. Your pediatrician can offer more advice, too.\n\nAdditional Common Questions\n---------------------------\n\n### Are blood clots in a nosebleed normal?\n\nYes. [Blood clots](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17675-blood-clots) are clumps of blood that form in reaction to an injured blood vessel. Blood clotting prevents excessive bleeding when a blood vessel is damaged. When you pinch your nose to stop a nosebleed, the blood will begin to clot. It’ll normally remain there until you remove it or gently blow your nose.\n\n### Why do I get frequent nosebleeds?\n\nThere are many reasons you may be getting frequent nosebleeds. They can affect one or both nostrils. The most common causes are:\n\n*   You frequently use nasal sprays to treat allergy symptoms or colds/congestion\n*   The air is dry where you live\n*   You snort drugs into your nose\n\nYou may need to stop using sprays for a short period or stop them altogether. Talk with your provider if you use these products.\n\nIn rare cases, repeated epistaxis could be a sign of a bleeding disorder or other more serious conditions. If you have frequent nosebleeds, see a healthcare provider.\n\n### A note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nEpistaxis, or a nosebleed, is a common yet irritating medical condition. Learn the steps for how to stop a nosebleed fast, and you’ll quickly be able to return to whatever you were doing before it started. Most cases of epistaxis aren’t serious. But you should see your healthcare provider if you get them frequently or have a bleeding disorder.\n\n### Care at Cleveland Clinic\n\nCleveland Clinic’s primary care providers offer lifelong medical care.

It can be classified into anterior, which is more common, and posterior, which is less frequent but often more severe and likely to require medical intervention. Anterior nosebleeds typically arise from Kiesselbach's plexus, located on the anterior nasal septum. Epistaxis can affect individuals of all ages and vary in severity, from minor cases that resolve with simple interventions to severe episodes requiring advanced medical care, including nasal packing or intubation in extreme cases.\n\nIn this course, participants learn the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of epistaxis, gaining insight into how to differentiate between anterior and posterior bleeds and apply appropriate management strategies. The course highlights the importance of interprofessional collaboration, involving primary care physicians, emergency care teams, otolaryngologists, and nursing staff, to ensure comprehensive care. Effective teamwork improves outcomes by facilitating timely interventions, managing complications, and providing patient-centered care that addresses both the acute issue and underlying risk factors for recurrent epistaxis.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n*   Differentiate between anterior and posterior nosebleeds based on clinical presentation.\n\n*   Screen patients for underlying risk factors and comorbidities contributing to recurrent epistaxis.\n\n*   Implement appropriate first-line interventions such as direct pressure, cauterization, or nasal packing.\n\n*   Communicate the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by epistaxis.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=21259&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=21259)\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nEpistaxis (nosebleed) is one of the most common ear, nose, and throat emergencies in the emergency department or the primary care clinic. There are 2 types of nosebleeds: anterior (more common) and posterior (less common but more likely to require medical attention). The source of 90% of anterior nosebleeds is within Kiesselbach plexus (also known as Little's area) on the anterior nasal septum. There are 5 named vessels whose terminal branches supply the nasal cavity.\n\n*   Anterior ethmoidal artery\n\n*   Posterior ethmoidal artery\n\n*   Sphenopalatine artery\n\n*   Greater palatine artery\n\n*   Superior labial artery\n\nThese 5 vessels' watershed areas are in the anterior nasal septum, comprising Kiesselbach plexus. This lies at the entrance to the nasal cavity and is subject to extremes of heat, cold, and high and low moisture; it is easily traumatized. The mucosa over the septum in this area is fragile, making this the site of most epistaxis. More rarely, posterior or superior nasal cavity vessels bleed, leading to the so-called \"posterior\" epistaxis. This is more common in patients on anticoagulants, patients who are hypertensive, and patients with underlying blood dyscrasia or vascular abnormalities. Management depends on the severity of the bleeding and the patient's concurrent medical problems.[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/#)[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/#)[[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/#)See **Image.**Nosebleed Vessels.\n\nEtiology\n--------\n\nThere are multiple causes of epistaxis, which can be divided into local, systemic, environmental, and medication-induced.\n\n**Local Causes**\n\nLocal causes of epistaxis include:\n\n*   Digital manipulation\n\n*   Deviated septum\n\n*   Trauma\n\n*   Chronic nasal cannula use\n\n**Systemic Causes**\n\nLocal causes of epistaxis include:\n\n*   Alcoholism\n\n*   Hypertension\n\n*   Vascular malformations\n\n*   Coagulopathies (von Willebrand disease, hemophilia)\n\n**Environmental Factors**\n\nEnvironmental factors in epistaxis include:\n\n*   Allergies\n\n*   Environmental dryness (more common in winter months)\n\n**Medications**\n\nMedications that can cause epistaxis include:\n\n*   Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs; ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin)\n\n*   Anticoagulants (warfarin)\n\n*   Platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel)\n\n*   Topical nasal steroid sprays\n\n*   Supplements or alternative medications (vitamin E, ginkgo, ginseng)\n\n*   Illicit drugs (cocaine)\n\nWhile epistaxis is a widespread spontaneous problem, rarer etiologies such as neoplasms or vascular malformations must always be in the differential diagnosis, particularly if additional symptoms such as unilateral nasal obstruction, pain, or other cranial nerve deficits are noted.[[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/#)[[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/#)[[6]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/#)\n\nEpidemiology\n------------\n\nNosebleeds are rarely fatal, accounting for only 4 of the 2.4 million deaths in the United States. About 60% of people have experienced a nosebleed, and only 10% are severe enough to warrant treatment or medical intervention. They occur most commonly in children aged 2 to 10 years old and older people between 50 and 80.\n\nPathophysiology\n---------------\n\nThe rupture of a blood vessel within the nasal mucosa causes nosebleeds. Rupture can be spontaneous, initiated by trauma, use of certain medications, and secondary to other comorbidities or malignancies. An increase in the patient's blood pressure can increase the episode's length. Anticoagulant medications, as well as clotting disorders, can also increase the bleeding time.\n\nMost nosebleeds occur in the anterior part of the nose (Kiesselbach plexus), and an etiologic vessel can usually be found on careful nasal examination. Bleeding from the posterior or superior nasal cavity is often termed a posterior nosebleed. This is usually presumed due to bleeding from the Woodruff plexus, the rear, and fine terminal branches of the sphenopalatine and posterior ethmoidal arteries. These are often difficult to control and are associated with bleeding from both nostrils or into the nasopharynx, where it is swallowed or coughed up, presenting as hemoptysis. This can generate a greater blood flow into the posterior pharynx, and there is a higher risk for airway compromise or aspiration due to increased difficulty controlling the bleeding.\n\nHistory and Physical\n--------------------\n\nThe history should include duration, severity, frequency, laterality of the bleeding, inciting event, and interventions provided before seeking care. Inquire about anticoagulants, aspirin, NSAIDs, and topical nasal steroid use. Obtain a relevant family history, particularly relating to coagulopathy and vascular/collagen disease, as well as any history of drug and alcohol use.\n\nPrepare proper equipment and proper personal protective equipment before beginning the physical examination. Equipment may include a nasal speculum, bayonet forceps, headlamp, suction catheter, packing, silver nitrate swabs, cotton pledgets, topical vasoconstrictor, and anesthetic. Have the patient seated in an exam chair in a room with suction available. Carefully insert the speculum and slowly open the blades to visualize the bleeding site. A headlight is essential for hands-free illumination, and the clot may need to be suctioned from the nasal cavity to identify the bleeding source. A posterior nosebleed is not easy to visualize and may be suggested by active bleeding into the posterior pharynx without a visualized vessel on nasal examination. Nasal endoscopy dramatically increases the success rate of identifying the bleeding source.\n\nEvaluation\n----------\n\nDifferentiating an anterior or posterior nosebleed is critical in management. Diagnosis of anterior bleeding can be made by direct visualization using a nasal speculum and light source. A topical spray with anesthetic and epinephrine may be helpful for vasoconstriction to help control bleeding and to aid in the visualization of the source. Usually, posterior bleeding is diagnosed after measures to control anterior bleeding have failed. Clinical features of posterior bleeding can include active bleeding into the posterior pharynx without an identified anterior source; high-flow posterior bleeds may cause blood to emanate from both nares. Labs may be obtained if necessary,including a complete blood cell count, type and cross match, and coagulation studies, though they should not delay treatment of an active bleed. Imaging such as x-rays or computed tomography have no role in the urgent or emergent management of active epistaxis.\n\nTreatment / Management\n----------------------\n\nStart with a primary survey and address the airway, ensuring it is patent. Next, assess for hemodynamic compromise. Obtain large-bore intravenous access in patients with severe bleeding and obtain labs. Reverse blood clotting as necessary if there is a concern with medication use.[[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/#)[[8]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/#)[[9]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/#)All patients with moderate to severe nose bleeding should have 2 large-bore intravenous lines and an infusion of crystalloid. Monitoring oxygen and hemodynamic stability is vital.\n\nTreatment for anterior bleeding can be started with direct pressure for at least 10 minutes. Have the patient apply constant direct pressure by pinching the nose over the cartilaginous tip (instead of over the bony areas) for a few minutes to control the bleeding. Vasoconstrictors such as oxymetazoline or thrombogenic foams or gels can be employed if that is ineffective. Remove all clots with suction before any attempt at treatment is made. The reasons are 2-fold:\n\n1.   Clot prevents any medication from reaching the vessel.\n\n2.   If packing becomes necessary, the clot can be pushed into the nasopharynx and aspirated.\n\nIf topical treatments are unsuccessful, proceed with nasal examination to identify and cauterize the vessel with silver nitrate. If this is unsuccessful, anterior nasal packing is necessary. This can be performed with absorbable packing material such as surgical or fibrillar or with devices such as anterior epistaxis balloons or nasal tampons. If silver nitrate is used to cauterize a septal blood vessel, only use it on 1 side of the septum to prevent septal perforation. Thermal coagulation is painful and should rarely be attempted in an emergent setting.\n\nTraditional petrolatum gauze can be used if one does not have access to balloons or tampons. If none of this is successful, the bleeding may be from the posterior or superior nasal cavity. Symptoms can include active bleeding from both nostrils or active bleeding present in the posterior pharynx. Longer (7.5 cm) nasal tampons provide more posterior pressure and can be employed in this situation. Formal posterior nasal packing should only be performed by experienced personnel as it requires admission, telemetry monitoring, and sometimes intubation; this is associated with higher rates of complications like pressure necrosis, infection, or hypoxia. A nasal-cardiac reflex may be triggered (ie, sudden bradycardia after nasal packing); if this occurs, remove the pack immediately). Foley catheters can be used by experienced personnel to tamponade a posterior bleed. If a rear pack is placed, a formal petrolatum gauze anterior pack must also be set to create a closed, tamponaded space in the nasopharynx. If these measures are unsuccessful, the patient should be intubated for airway protection, and interventional radiology should be consulted emergently for embolization. If this service is unavailable, an otolaryngologist can perform operative ligation of the sphenopalatine and ethmoid arteries in the operating room.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nThe differential diagnoses for epistaxis include the following:\n\n*   Nasal tumor\n\n*   Disseminated intravascular coagulation\n\n*   Hemophilia\n\n*   Von Willebrand disease\n\n*   Rhinitis\n\n*   Foreign body in the nose\n\n*   Drug toxicity (warfarin, NSAIDs)\n\nPostoperative and Rehabilitation Care\n-------------------------------------\n\nOnce the bleeding is controlled, arranging a timely follow-up (within 1 week) with their primary care clinician or an otolaryngologist is essential. If any packing has been placed, this must remain undisturbed for 3 to 5 days before removal. Patients should begin an antistaphylococcal antibiotic to prevent toxic shock syndrome. Underlying causes must be addressed before discharge (eg, tight blood pressure control with goal systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg), and patients should use topical nasal saline in both nares to keep the packs moist and facilitate removal.\n\nPearls and Other Issues\n-----------------------\n\nPatients with anterior nosebleeds can be discharged if the bleeding is controlled, hemodynamic stability is observed for at least 1 hour in the emergency department, and all predisposing factors are medically optimized. Follow-up with an otolaryngologist or their primary clinician should occur in 1 week, and they should begin nasal saline 3 times daily. If nonbiodegradable packing is used,patients should return to the emergency department or ear, nose, and throat clinician for packing removal in 3 to 5 days.\n\nIf a patient, including pediatric patients, requires posterior packing, admission is required to monitor for complications, particularly cardiac arrhythmias. All anticoagulants should ideally be discontinued but must be reversed or withheld to achieve the lowest dose acceptable if discontinuation is impossible. Applying topical saline sprays or ointments to the nasal mucosa to ensure moisturization of the nasal mucosa can help prevent recurrent epistaxis. Patients should also be advised to avoid hot foods, strenuous activity, blowing the nose, or digital manipulation of the nose on discharge.\n\nEnhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n----------------------------------\n\nAn interprofessional team best performs the care of nose bleeding. Most patients initially present to the emergency room; the triage nurse should fully know the importance of admitting patients with significant bleeding. While most anterior nosebleeds can be arrested with digital pressure, a follow-up appointment is recommended in patients with repeat episodes. Even though nurses may not perform invasive procedures to stop the bleeding, they can effectively instruct patients to properly compress the nose with their fingers, which can arrest the bleeding in most cases.\n\nNasal packing is another option, but the packing must be in place for 3 to 5 days, and repeated insertions and removals of various packs only exacerbate the bleeding (see **Image.**Epistaxis Management Supplies). Drug-induced nosebleeds may require a reversal of the international normalized ratio and admission. The pharmacist should ensure that the patient does not restart the NSAID or other anticoagulant while the bleeding is active. A hematologist consult is recommended to deal with patients with coagulopathy. In rare cases, embolization or cauterization may be required to stop a nosebleed. An ear, nose, and throat consultation is necessary if the bleeding is posterior and severe.\n\nIn some cases, the invasive radiologist may be required to perform embolization to stop the bleeding. Nurses should monitor the oxygen and hemodynamic status of all patients with moderate to severe nose bleeds. These patients should have intravenous access to the transfusion of crystalloids. The team members should communicate to ensure that the patient receives an acceptable standard of care treatment.\n\n[![Image 1: Epistaxis Management Supplies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/bin/Nasal__packing__posterior__redi.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/figure/article-21259.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435997/figure/article-21259.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nEpistaxis Management Supplies.Supplies such as rapid rhino examples anterior and posterior packing may be needed for packing.

Many people have occasional nosebleeds, particularly younger children and older adults.\n\nAlthough nosebleeds may be scary, they're generally only a minor annoyance and aren't dangerous. Frequent nosebleeds are those that occur more than once a week.\n\nThere is a problem with information submitted for this request.

\"Nose\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Fer2013-1) In some cases, [blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood \"Blood\") may flow down into the stomach, and cause [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea \"Nausea\") and [vomiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting \"Vomiting\").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-8) In more severe cases, blood may come out of both [nostrils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostrils \"Nostrils\").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-9) Rarely, bleeding may be so significant that [low blood pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_blood_pressure \"Low blood pressure\") occurs.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Fer2013-1) Blood may also be forced to flow up and through the [nasolacrimal duct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolacrimal_duct \"Nasolacrimal duct\") and out of the eye, producing [bloody tears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemolacria \"Haemolacria\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-10)\n\nRisk factors include trauma; especially from nosepicking, [blood thinners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulants \"Anticoagulants\"), [high blood pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_blood_pressure \"High blood pressure\"), [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism \"Alcoholism\"), [seasonal

serious.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Stat2019-3) Anterior nosebleeds generally occur from [Kiesselbach's plexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiesselbach%27s_plexus \"Kiesselbach's plexus\") while posterior bleeds generally occur from the [sphenopalatine artery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenopalatine_artery \"Sphenopalatine artery\") or [Woodruff's plexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodruff%27s_plexus \"Woodruff's plexus\").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Stat2019-3) The diagnosis is by direct

in the nose.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4) Initially, treatment is generally the application of pressure for at least five minutes over the lower half of the nose.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Tun2020-5) If this is not sufficient, [nasal packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_packing \"Nasal packing\") may be used.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Tun2020-5)[Tranexamic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranexamic_acid \"Tranexamic acid\") may also be helpful.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Jos2018-6) If bleeding episodes continue, [endoscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy \"Endoscopy\") is recommended.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Tun2020-5)\n\nAbout 60% of people have a nosebleed at some point in their life.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Wac2009-7) About 10% of nosebleeds are serious.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Wac2009-7) Nosebleeds are rarely fatal, accounting for only 4 of the 2.4 million deaths in the U.S. in 1999.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-11) Nosebleeds most commonly affect those younger than 10 and older than 50.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-AFP2005-2)\n\n[![Image

\"Vecsés\"), [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary \"Hungary\") in November 2006\n\nNosebleeds can occur due to a variety of reasons. Some of the most common causes include trauma from [nose picking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nose_picking \"Nose picking\"), blunt trauma (such as a motor vehicle accident), or insertion of a foreign object (more likely in children).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4) Low [relative humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity \"Relative humidity\") (such as in centrally heated buildings), [respiratory tract infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection \"Respiratory tract infection\"), [chronic sinusitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_sinusitis \"Chronic sinusitis\"), [rhinitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis \"Rhinitis\") or environmental [irritants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritant_(biology) \"Irritant (biology)\") can cause inflammation and thinning of the tissue in the nose, leading to a greater likelihood of bleeding from the nose.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4)\n\nMost causes of nose bleeding are self-limiting and do not require medical attention.

Rupture may be spontaneous or initiated by trauma. Anatomical deformities (e.g., septal spurs) can disrupt normal nasal airflow, leading to mucosal drying and crusting that predisposes to anterior epistaxis; epidemiologic studies have also shown an association between nasal septal deviation and recurrent epistaxis in adults.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-18) Nosebleeds are reported in up to 60% of the population with peak incidences in those under the age of ten and over the age of 50 and appear to occur in males more than females.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-AAFP-19) An increase in blood pressure (e.g. due to general hypertension) tends to increase the duration of spontaneous epistaxis.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-20)[Anticoagulant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant \"Anticoagulant\") medication and disorders of blood clotting can promote and prolong bleeding. Spontaneous epistaxis is more common in the elderly as the nasal mucosa (lining) becomes dry and thin and blood pressure tends to be higher. The elderly are also more prone to prolonged nosebleeds as their blood vessels are less able to constrict and control the bleeding.\n\nThe vast majority of nosebleeds occur in the front [anterior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior \"Anterior\") (front) part of the nose from the [nasal septum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum \"Nasal septum\"). This area is richly endowed with blood vessels ([Kiesselbach's plexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiesselbach%27s_plexus \"Kiesselbach's plexus\")). This region is also known as [Little's area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_area \"Little's area\"). Bleeding farther back in the nose is known as a posterior bleed and is usually due to bleeding from [Woodruff's plexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodruff%27s_plexus \"Woodruff's plexus\"), a venous plexus situated in the posterior part of inferior meatus.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-21) Posterior bleeds are often prolonged and difficult to control. They can be associated with bleeding from both nostrils and with a greater flow of blood into the mouth.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-AAFP-19)\n\nSometimes blood flowing from other sources of bleeding passes through the nasal cavity and exits the nostrils. It is thus blood coming from the nose but is not a true nosebleed, that is, not truly originating from the nasal cavity. Such bleeding is called \"pseudoepistaxis\" (_[pseudo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pseudo-#Prefix \"wikt:pseudo-\")_ + _epistaxis_). Examples include [blood coughed up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis \"Hemoptysis\") through the [airway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway \"Airway\") and ending up in the nasal cavity, then dripping out.\n\n[![Image 4: [icon]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg)This section **needs expansion**. You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nosebleed&action=edit&section=). _(February 2023)_\n\nPeople with uncomplicated nosebleeds can use conservative methods to prevent future nosebleeds such as sleeping in a humidified environment or applying [petroleum jelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_jelly \"Petroleum jelly\") to the nasal [nares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril \"Nostril\").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4)\n\nIndividuals who suffer from nosebleeds regularly, especially children, are encouraged to use over-the-counter nasal saline sprays and avoid vigorous nose-blowing as preventative measures.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-22)\n\nMost anterior nosebleeds can be stopped by applying [direct pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_bleeding_control \"Emergency bleeding control\"), which helps by promoting blood [clots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation \"Coagulation\").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4) Those who have a nosebleed should first attempt to blow out any blood [clots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation \"Coagulation\") and then apply pressure to the soft anterior part of the nose (by pinching the [nasal ala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose \"Human nose\"); not the bony [nasal bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bridge \"Nasal bridge\")) for at least five minutes and up to 30 minutes.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4) Pressure should be firm and tilting the head forward helps decrease the chance of nausea and airway obstruction due to blood dripping into the airway.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-AAFP-19) When attempting to stop a nosebleed at home, the head should not be tilted back.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-AFP2005-2) Swallowing excess blood can irritate the stomach and cause vomiting. [Vasoconstrictive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction \"Vasoconstriction\") medications such as [oxymetazoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymetazoline \"Oxymetazoline\") (Afrin) or [phenylephrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylephrine \"Phenylephrine\") are widely available over the counter for treatment of [allergic rhinitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis \"Allergic rhinitis\") and may also be used to control benign cases of epistaxis.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-pmid2676467-23) For example, a few sprays of [oxymetazoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymetazoline \"Oxymetazoline\") may be applied into the bleeding side(s) of the nose followed by application of direct pressure. Those with nosebleeds that last longer than 30 minutes (despite use of direct pressure and vasoconstrictive medications such as [oxymetazoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymetazoline \"Oxymetazoline\")) should seek medical attention.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4)\n\nClip used to stop a nosebleed\n\n*   [![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/NasalClip.jpg/250px-NasalClip.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NasalClip.jpg)\n\n*   [![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/NasalPressureAP.jpg/250px-NasalPressureAP.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NasalPressureAP.jpg)\n\n*   [![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/NasalPressureL.jpg/250px-NasalPressureL.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NasalPressureL.jpg)\n\n### Chemical cauterization\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nosebleed&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Chemical cauterization\")]\n\nThis method involves applying a chemical such as [silver nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_nitrate \"Silver nitrate\") to the nasal mucosa, which burns and seals off the bleeding.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-:1-12) Eventually the nasal tissue to which the chemical is applied will undergo [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis \"Necrosis\").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-:1-12) This form of treatment is best for mild bleeds, especially in children, that are clearly visible.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-:1-12) A topical anesthetic (such as [lidocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine \"Lidocaine\")) is usually applied prior to cauterization. Silver nitrate can cause blackening of the skin due to silver sulfide deposit, though this will fade with time.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-24) Once the [silver nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_nitrate \"Silver nitrate\") is deposited, [saline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine) \"Saline (medicine)\") may be used to neutralize any excess [silver nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_nitrate \"Silver nitrate\") via formation of [silver chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_chloride \"Silver chloride\") precipitate.\n\nIf pressure and chemical cauterization cannot stop bleeding, nasal packing is the mainstay of treatment.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-:2-25) Nasal packing is typically categorized into anterior nasal packing and posterior nasal packing.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kill2014-26) Nasal packing may also be categorized into dissolvable and non-dissolvable types.\n\nDissolvable nasal packing materials stop bleeding through use of thrombotic agents that promote blood clots, such as [surgicel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgicel \"Surgicel\") and [gelfoam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelfoam \"Gelfoam\").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4) The thrombogenic foams and gels do not require removal and dissolve after a few days. Typically, dissolvable nasal packing is first attempted; if the bleeding persists, non-dissolvable nasal packing is the next option.\n\nTraditionally, nasal packing was accomplished by packing gauze into the nose, thereby placing pressure on the vessels in the nose and stopping the bleeding. Traditional gauze packing has been replaced with other non-dissolvable nasal packing products such as [Merocel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_alcohol \"Polyvinyl alcohol\") and the Rapid Rhino.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-:2-25) The Merocel nasal tampon is similar to gauze packing except it is a synthetic foam polymer (made of polyvinyl alcohol and expands in the nose after application of water) that provides a less hospitable medium for bacteria.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4) The Rapid Rhino stops nosebleeds using a balloon catheter, made of [carboxymethylcellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxymethyl_cellulose \"Carboxymethyl cellulose\"), which has a cuff that is inflated by air to stop bleeding through extra pressure in the nasal cavity.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-:2-25) Systematic review articles have demonstrated that the efficacy in stopping nosebleeds is similar between the Rapid Rhino and [Merocel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merocel \"Merocel\") packs; however, the Rapid Rhino has been shown to have greater ease of insertion and reduced discomfort.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-:2-25) Posterior nasal packing can be achieved by using a [Foley catheter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_catheter \"Foley catheter\"), blowing up the balloon when it is in the back of the throat, and applying anterior traction so that the inflated balloon occludes the [choanae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choana \"Choana\").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kill2014-26) Patients who receive non-dissolvable nasal packing need to return to a medical professional in 24–72 hours in order to have packing removed.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Kell2014-4)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Stat2019-3) Complications of non-dissolvable nasal packing include [abscesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess \"Abscess\"), [septal hematomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septal_hematoma \"Nasal septal hematoma\"), [sinusitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis \"Sinusitis\"), and pressure necrosis.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-AFP2005-2) In rare cases [toxic shock syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_shock_syndrome \"Toxic shock syndrome\") can occur with prolonged nasal packing. As a result, any patient who has non-dissolvable nasal packing should be given prophylactic antibiotic medication to be taken as long as the nasal packing remains in the nose.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-AFP2005-2)\n\nOngoing bleeding despite good nasal packing is a surgical emergency and can be treated by endoscopic evaluation of the nasal cavity under general anesthesia to identify an elusive bleeding point or to directly ligate (tie off) the blood vessels supplying the nose. These blood vessels include the [sphenopalatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenopalatine_artery \"Sphenopalatine artery\"), anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries. More rarely the maxillary or a branch of the external [carotid artery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery \"Common carotid artery\") can be ligated. The bleeding can also be stopped by intra-arterial [embolization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization \"Embolization\") using a catheter placed in the groin and threaded up the aorta to the bleeding vessel by an [interventional radiologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology \"Interventional radiology\").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-NIH-27) There is no difference in outcomes between embolization and ligation as treatment options, but embolization is considerably more expensive.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-28) Continued bleeding may be an indication of more serious underlying conditions.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-NIH-27)\n\n[Tranexamic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranexamic_acid \"Tranexamic acid\") helps promote blood clotting.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Jos2018-6) For nosebleeds it can be applied to the site of bleeding, taken by mouth, or injected into a vein.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-Jos2018-6)\n\nThe utility of local cooling of the head and neck is controversial.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-29) Some state that applying ice to the nose or forehead is not useful.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-31) Others feel that it may promote vasoconstriction of the nasal blood vessels and thus be useful.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-32) In Indonesian traditional medicine, betel leaf is used to stop nosebleeds as it contains tannin which causes blood to coagulate, thus stopping active bleeding.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed#cite_note-33)\n\nSociety and culture\n-------------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?t\n...[内容已截断]"}], "from_cache": false}}, "actual_hops": 2, "success": true, "id": 4}

The cyclooxygenase active site catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid released from cell membranes, into prostaglandin G₂ (PGG₂), followed by peroxidase-mediated reduction to prostaglandin H₂ (PGH₂), the precursor for biologically active PGs (e.g., PGE₂, PGI₂, thromboxane A₂).  \n\nActivation of COX requires peroxidase activity: reduction of a peroxide substrate (e.g., H₂O₂) oxidizes the heme prosthetic group, generating a tyrosyl radical (Tyr-385) in the cyclooxygenase site. This radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from AA, initiating a cascade of reactions that form PGG₂. The peroxidase then reduces PGG₂ to PGH₂, regenerating the tyrosyl radical for subsequent catalytic cycles.  \n\n\n### **Isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2**  \n#### **COX-1**  \n- **Expression**: Constitutive and ubiquitous, found in most tissues (e.g., stomach, platelets, kidneys, blood vessels). Its stable 2.8 kb mRNA ensures baseline PG production for homeostatic functions.  \n- **Functions**: Synthesizes \"housekeeping\" PGs that regulate gastric mucosal protection, platelet aggregation (via thromboxane A₂), renal blood flow, and vascular tone.  \n\n#### **COX-2**  \n- **Expression**: Inducible by inflammatory stimuli (e.g., cytokines, growth factors, lipopolysaccharides) but also constitutively expressed in specific tissues (e.g., brain, kidneys, female reproductive tract). Its 4 kb mRNA has instability sequences, leading to rapid turnover.  \n- **Functions**: Traditionally linked to pathophysiological PG production during inflammation, pain, and tumorigenesis. However, emerging evidence shows homeostatic roles, including renal development, ovulation, embryo implantation, and resolution of inflammation.  \n\n\n### **Functional Differences Between Isoforms**  \n- **Substrate Specificity**: COX-2 metabolizes a broader range of substrates than COX-1, including endocannabinoids (e.g., 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]), ethanolamides, and ω-3 fatty acids. For example, COX-2 converts 2-AG to prostaglandin glyceryl esters (PG-Gs), which modulate calcium signaling and endocannabinoid tone.  \n- **Activation Requirements**: COX-2 is more sensitive to hydroperoxides, enabling activity at lower AA concentrations than COX-1, partly due to Thr-383 near the heme group.  \n- **Coupling to Downstream Enzymes**: COX-2 selectively couples with prostacyclin synthase (PGI₂ production), whereas COX-1 preferentially associates with thromboxane synthase, contributing to cardiovascular balance.  \n- **Aspirin Modification**: Aspirin irreversibly acetylates Ser-530 in both isoforms, blocking PG synthesis. However, acetylated COX-2 retains partial activity, generating 15-*R*-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-*R*-HETE), a precursor to anti-inflammatory lipoxins and resolvins.  \n\n\n### **Pharmacological Targeting: NSAIDs and COX Inhibitors**  \nCOX enzymes are the primary targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit PG synthesis to alleviate pain, fever, and inflammation.  \n\n#### **Classical NSAIDs**  \nNon-selective NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. While effective, they disrupt COX-1-mediated homeostatic PGs, causing gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (e.g., ulcers, bleeding) and impaired platelet function.  \n\n#### **COX-2-Selective Inhibitors (Coxibs)**  \nDesigned to spare COX-1, coxibs (e.g., celecoxib, rofecoxib) reduce GI side effects but carry cardiovascular risks. Inhibition of COX-2-derived PGI₂ (a vasodilator and antiplatelet agent) disrupts the balance with COX-1-derived thromboxane A₂ (a vasoconstrictor and proaggregant), increasing thrombotic events (e.g., heart attack, stroke). Rofecoxib and valdecoxib were withdrawn due to these risks, though celecoxib remains approved for select patients (e.g., those with NSAID-induced GI disease).  \n\n#### **Natural and Emerging Inhibitors**  \nSome natural compounds (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol) exhibit COX inhibitory activity, though their clinical relevance is unclear. Research also explores COX-2 targeting for cancer therapy, as COX-2 overexpression correlates with tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis.  \n\n\n### **Biological Roles Beyond Inflammation**  \n- **Cardiovascular System**: COX-2-derived PGI₂ maintains vascular homeostasis; its inhibition underlies coxib-associated cardiovascular toxicity.  \n- **Immune Regulation**: COX-1 and COX-2 modulate immune responses: COX-1 promotes inflammation in resident immune cells, while COX-2 aids resolution and wound healing.  \n- **Neurology**: Constitutive COX-1 and COX-2 in the brain regulate synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and pain signaling. COX-2 is upregulated in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s).  \n- **Oncology**: COX-2 overexpression occurs in colorectal, breast, and lung cancers, driving proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. NSAIDs and coxibs reduce colorectal polyp recurrence, supporting chemopreventive potential.  \n\n\n### **Clinical Implications and Controversies**  \nThe traditional paradigm—COX-1 as \"homeostatic\" and COX-2 as \"pathophysiological\"—is oversimplified. COX-1 contributes to inflammation, while COX-2 mediates critical homeostatic functions (e.g., renal development, ulcer healing). This complexity underscores the need for personalized NSAID use, balancing efficacy (e.g., pain relief) against risks (e.g., GI or cardiovascular toxicity).  \n\nOngoing research focuses on:  \n- Defining tissue-specific COX functions to develop isoform-selective or context-dependent inhibitors.  \n- Exploiting COX-2’s substrate promiscuity (e.g., metabolizing ω-3 fatty acids) for therapeutic benefit.  \n- Targeting COX-2 in cancer imaging and therapy, leveraging its overexpression in tumors.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nCyclooxygenases are central enzymes in lipid signaling, with COX-1 and COX-2 playing overlapping yet distinct roles in health and disease. Their structural and functional differences have guided NSAID development, but evolving insights into their pleiotropic effects continue to reshape therapeutic strategies. Balancing inhibition of pathological PGs with preservation of homeostatic functions remains a key challenge in optimizing COX-targeted therapies.", "page_summaries": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase", "title": "Cyclooxygenase", "summary": "Cyclooxygenase - Wikipedia\n\n===============\n[Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase#bodyContent)\n\n- [x] Main menu \n\nMain menu\n\nmove to sidebar hide\n\n Navigation \n\n*   [Main page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \"Visit the main page [alt-z]\")\n*   [Contents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents \"Guides to browsing Wikipedia\")\n*   [Current events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events \"Articles related to current events\")\n*   [Random article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random \"Visit a randomly selected article [alt-x]\")\n*   [About Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About \"Learn about Wikipedia and how it works\")\n*   [Contact us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us \"How to contact Wikipedia\")\n\n Contribute \n\n*   [Help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents \"Guidance on how to use and edit Wikipedia\")\n*   [Learn to edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction \"Learn how to edit Wikipedia\")\n*   [Community portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal \"The hub for editors\")\n*   [Recent changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges \"A list of recent changes to Wikipedia [alt-r]\")\n*   [Upload file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:File_upload_wizard \"Add images or other media for use on Wikipedia\")\n*   [Special pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:SpecialPages)\n\n[![Image 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png)![Image 4: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg)![Image 5: The Free Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)\n\n[Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search \"Search Wikipedia [alt-f]\")\n\nSearch\n\n- [x] Appearance \n\nAppearance\n\nmove to sidebar hide\n\nText\n\n*   Small  Standard  Large   \n\nThis page always uses small font size\n\nWidth\n\n*   Standard  Wide   \n\nThe content is as wide as possible for your browser window.\n\nColor (beta)\n\n*   Automatic  Light  Dark   \n\nThis page is always in light mode.\n\n*   [Donate](https://donate.wikimedia.org/?wmf_source=donate&wmf_medium=sidebar&wmf_campaign=en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en)\n*   [Create account](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Cyclooxygenase \"You are encouraged to create an account and log in; however, it is not mandatory\")\n*   [Log in](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cyclooxygenase \"You're encouraged to log in; however, it's not mandatory.

[enzyme](https://en.wi\n...[内容已截断]"}, {"url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/", "title": "Cyclooxygenases: structural and functional insights", "summary": "[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/)Abstract\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCyclooxygenase (COX; prostaglandin G/H synthase, EC 1.14.99.1) catalyzes the first two steps in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (PGs). The two COX isoforms COX-1 and COX-2 are the targets of the widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indicating a role for these enzymes in pain, fever, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. The ubiquitous constitutive expression of COX-1 and inducible expression of COX-2 have led to the widely held belief that COX-1 produces homeostatic PGs, while PGs produced by COX-2 are primarily pathophysiological. However, recent discoveries call this paradigm into question and reveal as yet underappreciated functions for both enzymes. This review focuses on some of these new insights.\n\n**Keywords:** prostaglandin, endocannabinoid, inflammation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, coxib, hydroperoxide, arachidonic acid, essential fatty acid\n\n* * *\n\nThe cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) are among the most thoroughly studied and best understood mammalian oxygenases. Possessing two separate but linked active sites, the COXs catalyze the _bis_-dioxygenation and subsequent reduction of arachidonic acid (AA) to prostaglandin (PG)G 2 and PGH 2 ([**Fig. 1A**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#fig1)). The mechanism of oxygenation has been well characterized through kinetics, mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib1)–[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib3)). PGH 2 is subject to metabolism by downstream enzymes yielding the family of PGs, each member of which exerts a range of physiologic effects through specific G-protein-coupled receptors ([Fig. 1B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#fig1)) ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib5)). The discovery that the COXs are the target of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which play a primary therapeutic role in the treatment of pain, fever, and inflammation ([6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib6)), promulgated the first wave of experimentation on the constitutively expressed COX-1 during the 1970s and 1980s. Then, just as interest began to wane, the discovery of the inducible isoform, COX-2, rekindled a massive new effort that ultimately led to new insights about both isoforms. A search of PubMed over the past 2 years indicates that there have been over 70 review articles containing “cyclooxygenase” in their title, leading one to question the need for yet another. However, despite the overwhelming mass of data available on these enzymes, recent discoveries suggest that some original assumptions concerning their roles in physiology and pathophysiology require reexamination. This review will emphasize these issues.\n\nFig. 1.\n-------\n\n[![Image 1: Fig. 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cb10/2674713/cdfccac05f90/JLR50SUPPS29f1.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2674713_JLR50SUPPS29f1.jpg)\n\nThe cyclooxygenase reaction. A: The peroxidase cycle leads to abstraction of a hydrogen atom from Tyr-385 forming a tyrosyl radical and activating the cyclooxygenase active site. The tyrosyl radical abstracts the pro-_S_ hydrogen atom from carbon-13 of AA, initiating the cyclooxygenase reaction, the final step of which regenerates the tyrosyl radical. B: Conversion of PGH 2 to the biologically active PGs.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/)STRUCTURE OF THE COX ENZYMES\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHuman COX-1 and COX-2 are homodimers of 576 and 581 amino acids, respectively. Both enzymes contain three high mannose oligosaccharides, one of which facilitates protein folding. A fourth oligosaccharide, present only in COX-2, regulates its degradation. Considering the 60% identity in sequence between COX-1 and COX-2, it is not surprising that their three-dimensional structures are nearly superimposable. Each subunit of the dimer consists of three domains, the epidermal growth factor domain (residues 34–72), the membrane binding domain (residues 73–116), and the catalytic domain comprising the bulk of the protein, which contains the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase active sites on either side of the heme prosthetic group ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib1), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib2), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib7), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib8)).\n\nOn the opposite side of the protein from the membrane binding domain, the peroxidase active site consists of the heme positioned at the bottom of a shallow cleft. This structure provides considerable solvent accessibility to the heme with the exception of a cluster of several hydrophobic amino acids that form a dome over part of the cleft. The structure of the active site helps to explain the promiscuous substrate specificity of the COX peroxidase, which reduces a wide range of primary and secondary organic hydroperoxides ([9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib9)). Although the hydrophobic dome would appear to explain the preference of the peroxidase for organic peroxides over H 2 O 2, mutation of the dome residues to alanine has little effect on peroxidase activity or substrate specificity ([10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib10)).\n\nThe cyclooxygenase active site lies on the opposite side of the heme from the peroxidase active site at the top of an L-shaped channel that originates in the membrane binding domain. The mouth of the channel consists of the lobby, a large volume that narrows to a constriction that must open before substrates or inhibitors can pass deeper into the channel. Above the constriction, the channel is surrounded by hydrophobic residues, which outline the nearly right angle bend and the narrow terminus. When AA binds in the cyclooxygenase active site, it lies with its carboxyl group at the constriction and its ω-methyl group at the narrow terminus of the channel. This places carbon-13 of AA at the bend in the channel in close proximity to Tyr-385, which is the critical catalytic amino acid for the cyclooxygenase reaction ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib1), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib2), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib8)).\n\n### Mechanism of the cyclooxygenase reaction\n\nThe first step in the conversion of AA to the hydroperoxy-endoperoxide, PGG 2, is abstraction of the pro-_S_ hydrogen atom from carbon-13. The steps that follow ([Fig. 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#fig1)) are consistent with the mechanism of nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, so the main contributions of COX to PGG 2 formation are to restrict the options for hydrogen abstraction and dictate reaction stereochemistry. Cyclooxygenase catalysis requires that the enzyme first be activated, a process dependent on the peroxidase activity. Two-electron reduction of a peroxide substrate results in the oxidation of the ferric heme to an oxo-ferryl porphyrin radical cation. Transfer of an electron to the heme from Tyr-385 of the protein generates a tyrosyl radical in the cyclooxygenase active site. This radical, as noted above, is positioned perfectly to abstract the pro-_S_ hydrogen from carbon-13 of AA, initiating the cycloxygenase reaction ([Fig. 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#fig1)). The final step of the reaction, reduction of the peroxyl radical to the hydroperoxide to form PGG 2, regenerates the tyrosyl radical. Thus, activated COX can carry out multiple turnovers without need to repeat the activation step. After initiating the cyclooxygenase reaction, the primary function of the peroxidase is to reduce the 15-hydroperoxy of PGG 2 to the corresponding alcohol of PGH 2 ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib1)–[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib3)).\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/)COX-1 AND COX-2: STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOX-1 is widely distributed and constitutively expressed in most tissues where it is found. Its gene, _Ptgs-1_, codes for a 2.8 kb mRNA, which is relatively stable. By contrast, the gene for COX-2, _Ptgs-2_, is an immediate early gene that is activated by a wide variety of inflammatory and proliferative stimuli, and the 4 kb COX-2 mRNA turns over rapidly due to the presence of instability sequences in the 3′-untranslated region ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib1), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib2)). The difference in the pattern of gene expression provides an obvious explanation for the existence of the two COX isoforms, suggesting that COX-1 provides PGs that are required for homeostatic functions, including gastric cytoprotection and hemostasis, whereas COX-2 plays the predominant role in PG formation during pathophysiologic states, such as inflammation and tumorigenesis. This “COX-2 hypothesis” drove the rapid development of selective COX-2 inhibitors, which were predicted to have anti-inflammatory activity without the gastrointestinal side effects of traditional NSAIDs ([11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib11), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib12)). However, continued studies with mice genetically deficient in COX-1 or COX-2 as well as clinical experience with COX-2 selective inhibitors (see below) have raised questions about this widely accepted paradigm of COX function.\n\n### Differential expression of COX-1 and COX-2\n\nAutopsy samples from 20 healthy human trauma victims show relatively uniform COX-1 expression in nearly all tissues, with most of the protein localized to the blood vessels, smooth muscle cells, interstitial cells, platelets, and mesothelial cells. Although more highly variable, COX-2 protein was found in nearly all tissues and was most often localized to parenchymal cells ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib13)). Constitutive COX-2 expression is well recognized in brain, kidney, and the female reproductive tract, and evidence for induction of COX-1 during the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response and cellular differentiation has been reported ([14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib14)–[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib18)). Although these data generally support the COX-2 hypothesis, they also show that expression of neither enzyme fully fits the paradigm.\n\n### Physiologic versus pathophysiologic roles\n\nCOX-1 is constitutively expressed in resident inflammatory cells, and results of studies from COX-1 knockout mice and selective inhibitors confirm a role for COX-1 in multiple inflammatory models. Adding complexity are the findings that COX-2 deletion or inhibition may lead to reduction or exacerbation of the inflammatory response, depending on the model. COX-2 appears to play a significant role in resolution of inflammation, a role that is important in the healing of gastric ulcers. This latter finding, combined with the fact that COX-1 knockout mice do not display increased susceptibility to ulceration and that COX-1 selective inhibitors do not induce gastric lesions, calls into question the putative gastric cytoprotective role usually ascribed to COX-1. In fact, ulceration is observed with a combination of COX-1 and COX-2 selective inhibitors, indicating that reduction in the total levels of PGs is more important than inhibition of PGs generated from a particular COX enzyme. Recent studies suggest that the roles of the isoforms are reversed in the brain because COX-1 knockout mice exhibit a reduced inflammatory response to intrathecal LPS, whereas COX-2 knockout mice display exacerbated inflammation ([16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib16), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib19)–[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib21)).\n\nStudies with COX-2 knockout mice demonstrate homeostatic functions for this isoform. Genetic deletion of COX-2 produces a severe disruption of postnatal kidney development, and female knockout mice are infertile due to failure of ovulation and embryo implantation ([15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib15), [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib16)). As noted below, the cardiotoxicity associated with the prolonged use of COX-2 selective inhibitors confirms a homeostatic role for COX-2 in the cardiovascular system ([22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib22), [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib23)). Thus, it is clear that the original COX-2 hypothesis ascribing a homeostatic function to COX-1 and a pathophysiologic function to COX-2 is oversimplified and in some cases completely erroneous.\n\n### Differential functions of the COX proteins\n\nIf the only basis for the differences between the COX isoforms was their differential gene expression, then replacing the gene for COX-2 with that for COX-1 should produce no noticeable phenotype. However, “knockin” of the COX-1 gene into the COX-2 locus in mice only partially replenishes the deficit in PGI 2 synthesis and fails to fully ameliorate defects in reproductive and renal function associated with COX-2 deletion ([24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib24)). These results clearly indicate that COX-1 and COX-2 are not functionally interchangeable at the protein level.\n\nOne basis for the results of the COX-1 knockin study may lie in differential coupling between the two COX proteins and downstream synthases. For example, lack of full restoration of PGI 2 synthesis by COX-1 knockin may be due to a failure of coupling between COX-1 with PGI synthase. Numerous studies support selective isoform association ([25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib25), [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib26)), but much of this work has been done with cells overexpressing the relevant enzymes, and no basis for the differential coupling has been advanced. Therefore, confirmation of this hypothesis awaits further investigation.\n\nAn alternative explanation for the difference in isoform function may be that COX-2 requires lower concentrations of hydroperoxide for activation than does COX-1 ([27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib27)). Although this difference does not usually affect kinetic parameters measured in vitro, within the reducing environment of the intact cell, it translates into an ability of COX-2 to function at lower AA concentrations than COX-1 ([24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib24), [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib26), [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib28)). The structural and mechanistic bases for the difference in hydroperoxide requirement are not fully understood, but site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that Thr-383, a residue near the heme in COX-2, is at least partly responsible for its greater hydroperoxide sensitivity ([25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib25)).\n\nA third explanation for the differences in function between COX-1 and COX-2 may lie in COX-2's wider substrate specificity. For example, COX-2 is capable of metabolizing ester and amide derivatives of AA that are poor substrates for COX-1 ([29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib29)). Of particular interest are the glyceryl ester and ethanolamide of AA, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and arachidonoyl ethanolamide, respectively, which are endogenous ligands for the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors ([**Fig. 2**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#fig2)). The products of 2-AG and arachidonoyl ethanolamide metabolism by COX-2 are the glyceryl ester and ethanolamide derivatives of PGH 2 (PGH 2-G and PGH 2-EA, respectively), which are subject to further metabolism by the same enzymes that metabolize PGH 2, with the exception of thromboxane synthase. Thus, formation of glyceryl ester or ethanolamide analogs of PGE 2, PGF 2α, PGD 2, and PGI 2 is possible, depending on the enzymes present in the environment.\n\n#### Fig. 2.\n\n[![Image 2: Fig. 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cb10/2674713/eb547df0fda6/JLR50SUPPS29f2.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2674713_JLR50SUPPS29f2.jpg)\n\nSelective COX-2 substrates. The structures of endocannabinoids and free fatty acids that are metabolized more efficiently by COX-2 than by COX-1 are shown.\n\nProstaglandin gyceryl esters (PG-Gs) are subject to hydrolysis by esterases present in blood and tissues, which confounds efforts to detect them in vivo. Nevertheless, low levels of PG-Gs have been observed in rat paw tissue and in cultures of LPS-pretreated murine resident peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells stimulated with zymosan and ionomycin, respectively. These results suggest that PG-Gs may be produced under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. A growing number of studies suggest a physiologic role for COX-2-dependent 2-AG oxygenation, including evidence of calcium mobilization through distinct and novel receptors, activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ, and regulation of endocannabinoid tone ([29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib29)–[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib31)).\n\nDifferences in substrate specificity between the COX isoforms are not limited to neutral derivatives of 20:4. Indeed, COX-2 has greater capacity to oxygenate a number of polyunsaturated free fatty acids that are poor substrates for COX-1 ([Fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#fig2)) ([26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib26), [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib32)). Since these include ω-3 fatty acids, it is possible that the differential use of these lipids by the COX enzymes may help to explain the health benefits of dietary ω-3 fatty acids, a hypothesis that remains an intriguing subject for future work ([33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib33)).\n\nA final difference in COX isoform function that may be of physiologic significance lies in the ability of the aspirin-treated enzymes to oxygenate AA. Aspirin inhibits PG formation by both isoforms via covalent modification of Ser-530 in the cyclooxygenase active site. However, COX-2 retains the capacity to oxygenate AA, resulting in the formation of 15 _R_-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid instead of PGG 2 ([34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib34)). Through this lipoxygenase-type reaction, aspirin-treated COX-2, together with other lipoxygenases, forms polyhydroxylated lipids known as aspirin-triggered lipoxins and resolvins. Since these lipids have anti-inflammatory activity, their production may help to explain some of the clinical benefits of aspirin ([35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib35)).\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/)COX INHIBITION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### COX-2-selective inhibitors: clinical experience\n\nDating to Egyptian times, the clinical use of NSAIDs far preceded the characterization of COX as their molecular target ([6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib6)). Aspirin is the only clinically used NSAID that covalently modifies the COX protein. All other NSAIDs act noncovalently and most can be classified as either rapidly reversible, competitive inhibitors or slow, tight binding inhibitors. The kinetics and mechanism of inhibitor binding were recently reviewed in detail ([36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib36)). Despite the fact that NSAIDs block all PG synthesis, they are efficacious and relatively safe drugs. However, a range of hazardous side effects, of which gastrointestinal toxicity is of primary clinical importance, preclude NSAID use in highly sensitive patients. Based on the COX-2 hypothesis, the obvious solution to the gastrointestinal toxicity of NSAIDS was the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors. The resultant massive effort in the pharmaceutical industry placed new drugs, the coxibs, on the market within 8 years after the discovery of COX-2 ([23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib23)).\n\nAlthough more recent data question the basic premise of the COX-2 hypothesis, the coxibs, including celecoxib (Celebrex), rofecoxib (Vioxx), and valdecoxib (Bextra), proved to have good anti-inflammatory activity, and some exhibited reduced gastrointestinal toxicity. Aggressive marketing resulted in widespread use even among patients who did not experience gastrointestinal toxicity with NSAIDs. Reports of increased COX-2 expression in numerous forms of cancer led to several large-scale clinical trials exploring the benefits of chronic celecoxib or rofecoxib to prevent colon polyp recurrence. Those studies confirmed the value of coxibs for this purpose, but also revealed significant cardiovascular toxicity associated with chronic use (2–4% of patients after 3 years). This finding eventually led to the removal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib from the market ([23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib23)).\n\nThe preponderance of data suggests that the cardiotoxicity of COX-2-selective inhibitors is mechanism-based and likely associated with the inhibition of PGI 2 synthesis in the blood vessel wall. However, the fact that only a relatively small percentage of patients suffered cardiovascular side effects after 3 years of drug exposure suggests that other factors also contribute. The discovery of the cardiovascular toxicity of COX-2-selective inhibitors refutes the initial hypothesis that COX-2 plays no role in homeostasis. It also has led to concerns that traditional NSAIDs may carry unrecognized cardiovascular side effects. There are no well-controlled studies of the long-term toxicity of NSAIDs, but meta-analysis suggests the potential of some cardiovascular risk with these drugs ([22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib22), [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib23)).\n\n### COX-2 inhibitors: future prospects\n\nFollowing the removal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib from the market, COX-2 inhibitors were rejected almost as enthusiastically (and perhaps as irrationally) as they had been embraced. It is arguable that initially use of these drugs should have been restricted to people who suffered gastrointestinal toxicity from NSAIDs. Similarly, the relatively low incidence of cardiovascular events suggests that a large portion of the population can take COX-2-selective inhibitors safely, especially for short courses of therapy. Thus, a careful risk-benefit analysis might identify a population of patients for which COX-2-selective inhibitors should remain the drug of choice.\n\nA possible application of COX-2-selective inhibitors may lie in the detection and/or treatment of cancer ([37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib37)–[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib39)). As noted above, COX-2 expression is elevated in a large number of malignancies, so a COX-2 ligand should accumulate selectively in tumor tissue compared with surrounding normal tissue. Such a ligand, if appropriately labeled, could serve as an imaging agent for cancer diagnosis ([40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib40)). Similar logic may be applied to the use of COX-2-directed ligands for the development of anti-cancer agents.\n\nPromising results for the development of COX-2-directed imaging agents have been achieved through modification of coxibs to produce probes for PET and SPECT imaging ([41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib41)–[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib44)). However, full realization of the potential of this approach requires the ability to attach a wide variety of imaging or therapeutic moieties to a COX-2 binding nucleus. Such flexibility has been achieved through the discovery that amidation or esterification of carboxylate-containing NSAIDs conveys COX-2 selectivity. Extensive work has shown that a large number of indomethacin primary and secondary amides and esters of great structural diversity are potent and selective COX-2 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo ([36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib36), [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/#bib45)). This implies that a large number of possible imaging or antitumor moieties may be easily tethered to indomethacin through amide or ester linkage with a strong likelihood of generating a selective COX-2 inhibitor.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/)CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom the perspective of enzymology and protein biochemistry, the study of the COX enzymes may be considered a mature field. There are few enzymes of lipid biochemistry for which there is such a wealth of structural and functional information. Yet, as the story of the discovery of COX-2 with the subsequent rise and fall of the coxibs so clearly illustrates, our most strongly supported paradigms must be subject to constant scrutiny. Ongoing work is presently focused on better defining the functional differences between the COX proteins and rationally evaluating an appropriate use for COX isoform-selective inhibition.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/)Abbreviations\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   AA, arachidonic acid\n\n*   2-AG, 2-arachydonoylglycerol\n\n*   COX, cyclooxygenase\n\n*   LPS, lipopolysaccharide\n\n*   NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammmatory drug\n\n*   PG, prostaglandin\n\n*   PG-G, prostaglandin gyceryl ester\n\nResearch on COX structure and function in the authors' laboratory is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (CA-89450 and GM-15431).\n\nPublished, JLR Papers in Press, October 23, 2008.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2674713/)References\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   1.Smith W.

It is an effective painkiller. It reduces fever and inflammation when the body gets overzealous in its defenses against infection and damage. It slows blood clotting, reducing the chance of stroke and heart attack in susceptible individuals. And, there is growing evidence that it is an effective addition to the fight against cancer. This wonder drug, with manifold uses in medicine, is aspirin. Aspirin has been used professionally for a century, and traditionally since ancient times. A similar compound found in willow bark, salicylic acid, has a long history of use in herbal treatment. But only in the last few decades have we understood how aspirin works, and how it might be improved.\n\n#### Prostaglandins\n\nAs you might expect from a drug with such diverse actions, aspirin blocks a central process in the body. Aspirin blocks the production of prostaglandins, key hormones that are used to carry local messages. Unlike most hormones, which are produced in specialized glands and then delivered throughout the body by the blood, prostaglandins are created by cells and then act only in the surrounding area before they are broken down. Prostaglandins control many of these neighborhood processes, including the constriction of muscle cells around blood vessels, aggregation of platelets during blood clotting, and constriction of the uterus during labor. Prostaglandins also deliver and strengthen pain signals and induce inflammation. These many different processes are all controlled by different prostaglandins, but all created from a common precursor molecule.\n\nCyclooxygenase (shown here from PDB entry [1prh](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1prh)) performs the first step in the creation of prostaglandins from a common fatty acid, as shown in the box. It adds two oxygen molecules to arachidonic acid, beginning a set of reactions that will ultimately create a host of unusual molecules. Aspirin blocks the binding of arachidonic acid in the cyclooxygenase active site. The normal messages are not delivered, so we don't feel the pain and don't launch an inflammation response.\n\n#### COX-1 and COX-2\n\nWe actually build two different cyclooxygenases (termed COX-1 and COX-2) for different purposes. COX-1 is built in many different cells to create prostaglandins used for basic housekeeping messages throughout the body. The second enzyme is built only in special cells and is used for signaling pain and inflammation. Unfortunately, aspirin attacks both. Since COX-1 is targeted, aspirin can lead to unpleasant complications, such as stomach bleeding. Fortunately, specific compounds that block just COX-2, leaving COX-1 to perform its essential jobs, are now becoming available. These new drugs are selective pain-killers and fever reducers, without the unpleasant side-effects.\n\n* * *\n\n![Image 2: Cyclooxygenase, showing the entry into the active site from the membrane (blue at the bottom).

The drug indomethacin is bound in the active site._\n\n[Download high quality TIFF image](https://cdn.rcsb.org/pdb101/motm/17/17-Cyclooxygenase-4cox_tunnel.tif)\n\n#### A Complex Enzyme\n\nThis enzyme actually has two different active sites, collectively termed prostaglandin synthase. On one side, it has the cyclooxygenase active site discussed on the previous page. On the opposite side, is has an entirely separate peroxidase site, which is needed to activate the heme groups that participate in the cyclooxygenase reaction. The enzyme complex is a dimer of identical subunits, so altogether, there are two cyclooxygenase active sites and two peroxidase active sites in close proximity. Each subunit has a knob covered with hydrophobic amino acids, pointing downward in this illustration. These knobs anchor the complex to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, shown in light blue at the bottom of the picture. The cyclooxygenase active site is buried deep within the protein, and is reachable by a tunnel that opens out in the middle of the knob. This acts like a funnel, guiding arachidonic acid out of the membrane and into the enzyme for processing. In the structure shown here, PDB entry [4cox](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=4cox), a drug (yellow and green) is blocking the active site in both subunits. The heme groups are also shown above the drug in each subunit.\n\n* * *\n\n#### Exploring the Structure\n\n![Image 3](https://cdn.rcsb.org/pdb101/motm/17/1pth.gif)\n\nPDB entry [1pth](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1pth) shows how aspirin blocks the cyclooxygenase active site. Aspirin is composed of two parts: an acetyl group attached to salicylic acid. When it attacks cyclooxygenase, it connects its acetyl group to a serine amino acid, permanently inactivating the enzyme. The picture shown here is a close-up of the active site after aspirin has performed its job. The acetyl group (shown in white and red) is attached to the serine amino acid (bright green), and the salicylic acid (large spheres) is bound close by. The backbone of the protein is shown in dark green.\n\nThis illustration was created with RasMol. You can create similar pictures by clicking on the PDB accession code above and picking one of the options for 3D viewing. Note that this structure includes only one of the two subunits, so when you look at the structure, you will be looking at only half of the entire complex. Also, a modified form of aspirin, with a bromine atom attached, was used in this structure; the bromine atom is not shown in this picture.\n\n* * *\n\n#### References\n\n1.   Lawrence J.
