## ✨ Highlights (Figures)

### Figure 1 — General vs Medical Search + DeepMed Gains
> **(up)** General search tasks typically provide definitive answers online, but medical tasks are different; while online information can assist, the final answer relies on medical reasoning.  
> **(down)** **DeepMed** shows significant improvements over its base reasoning model on medical benchmarks, and outperforms larger medical reasoning model and general DR models.
